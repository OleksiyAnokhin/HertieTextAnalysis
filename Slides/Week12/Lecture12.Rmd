## Today's outline

- Topic Models
- Wrapping up

## Topic models: basic idea

- Perhaps you don’t want to, or can’t write a dictionary yourself.
- Perhaps you worry about measurement error

- Topic models (Blei and Lafferty, 2009) are exploratory probability models that

    + weaken the contraints required in dictionary based content analysis
    + have been intensively studied in the computer science literature 

These are exploratory methods that work best with large amounts of text with a thematic structure.

## Topic models: LDA

Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) is a popular method for fitting a topic model. It treats each document as a mixture of topics, and each topic as a mixture of words. 

```{r, out.width = "220px", echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics("img/lda1.png")
```  

## Topic models: LDA (II)

```{r, out.width = "250px", echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics("img/lda2.png")
```  

## Topic models: LDA (III)

```{r, out.width = "250px", echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics("img/lda3.png")
```  

## Topic models: LDA (IV)

```{r, out.width = "250px", echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics("img/lda4.png")
```  

## Topic model: LDA (V)

- Topic models giveth:

    + a probabilistic view of the relationship between W, Z and $\theta$
    + a full statistical framework for learning most aspects of the relationship

- and taketh away:

    + substantive control: You do not get to assert what the topics mean (inevitable when the Z and $\theta$ are both unobserved)

## Topic model: LDA (VI)

- What control is left?

    + $\alpha$ the parameter of a Dirichlet prior for the distributions (not number) of topics
    + $\eta$ the parameter of a Dirichlet prior over the distributions of words in topics

- Roughly, larger values allow more variation and less sparse representations
- Topic models are admixtures: mixtures of mixtures


## Variations: dynamic topic models (II)

```{r, out.width = "250px", echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics("img/dynamictm.png")
```  

- Quinn et al. analyze 118,065 such congressional speeches from
1997-2004.

- $\theta$ has Markovian dynamics for smooth movement in topic proportions.
- Note: This does not allow variation in the way topics are expressed in
words

## Application: policy agenda

```{r, out.width = "230px", echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics("img/policyagenda.png")
```  

## Defining topics

```{r, out.width = "250px", echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics("img/definingTopics.png")
```  

## Defining topics (II)

```{r, out.width = "230px", echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics("img/clustering.png")
``` 

## Defining topics (III)

```{r, out.width = "250px", echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics("img/clustering2.png")
``` 

## Variations: expressed agenda model

In a simpler variation on LDA, Grimmer (2009) defines an expressed agenda model as

```{r, out.width = "250px", echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics("img/grimmer.png")
``` 

- Here there are not multiple topics per press release, but there are
observed authors drawn from a population

## Variations: correlated topic models

- The Dirichlet multinomial assumptions hide a constraint about topic
covariation

    + LDA cannot represent free covariation of topic proportions
    + The correlated topic model can

- Replace the Dirichlet with a Logistic Normal structure (Aitchison, 1986)
with arbitrary covariance matrix

## Topic models in R

- `topicmodels`

    + LDA & CTM

-     
    
## Text analysis workflow

```{r, out.width = "250px", echo = F}
