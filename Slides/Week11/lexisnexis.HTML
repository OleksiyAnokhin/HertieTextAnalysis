</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">By THE EDITORIAL BOARD</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Section A; Column 0; Editorial Desk; EDITORIAL; Pg. 20</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">578 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The first reports about the arbitrary detention and possible extrajudicial killings of men suspected of being gay in Chechnya were bloodcurdling. The authorities began rounding up men after activists had sought permission to hold gay pride parades in other parts of the North Caucasus region, which is predominantly Muslim, according to a newspaper report and activists. At least three turned up dead. Some people reported being tortured.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Then came the baffling denial. ''If such people existed in Chechnya, law enforcement would not have to worry about them, as their own relatives would have sent them to where they could never return,'' Alvi Karimov, a spokesman for the Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov, told the Russian news agency Interfax. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  This abominable crime by a Russian republic and its reprehensible cover-up warrant a strong response from Moscow and the international community. That would be a stretch for the Russian government, which is denying that there is evidence of any crimes and has sought to keep its own gay population invisible. In 2013, it enacted a so-called anti-propaganda law that criminalizes promoting or celebrating non-straight conduct and identity -- while government officials claimed that all Russians were entitled to protection from discrimination and violence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Moscow's ''reaction to the allegations of systematic human rights violations against gay men in Chechnya constitutes a litmus test on whether this rhetoric was disingenuous,'' said Fabrice Houdart, a human rights expert at the United Nations who specializes in issues of sexual orientation and gender identity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Moreover, it should force a debate about how that kind of out-of-sight, out-of-mind approach contributes to the stigmatization and victimization of vulnerable communities. Gay and transgender people have gained societal acceptance and legal rights in several countries over the past two decades by demanding to be seen and heard. The Russian government persists in forcing its gay citizens to remain largely underground.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Moscow is unlikely to take meaningful action against Chechnya, or to rethink its broader policy toward gay rights, in the absence of strong and sustained international pressure. In recent years several countries from the Americas and Europe have promoted equality for gay and transgender people as universal human rights. The Obama administration, and in particular former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, deserves much credit for making this a diplomatic priority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The crimes in Chechnya have presented the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> administration with its first major test on this issue on the international stage. Last Monday, Nikki Haley, the American ambassador to the United Nations, issued a strong statement calling for a prompt investigation and accountability for the culprits.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We are against all forms of discrimination, including against people based on sexual orientation,'' Ms. Haley said. ''When left unchecked, discrimination and human rights abuses can lead to destabilization and conflict.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It would be encouraging to see Ms. Haley take on this cause with as much passion and perseverance as her predecessor, Samantha Power. Without American leadership, forging a global consensus that gay rights are human rights will take longer. Time is not on the side of gay people living in terror in places like Chechnya.</SPAN></P>

Mr. Kraft's loyalty to the president dates partly to Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> thoughtfulness when Mr. Kraft's wife died, not when his father died.

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Bren Smith is a kelp and shellfish farmer and the founder of Greenwave.

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Consider the pollock.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">It is the most voluminously caught fish in the United States, accounting for a quarter of everything Americans catch. As such it is the major bulwark against the United States' multibillion-dollar seafood trade deficit -- the second-largest deficit in our trade portfolio, after crude oil. And it is, today, the main component in the McDonald's Filet-O-Fish, or the ''fish delight,'' as Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> likes to call it. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Now consider the president's budget for the people who make his preferred sandwich possible.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  If Congress seriously entertains the White House's suggestions, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration -- a popular target for conservatives, who see it primarily as a source of pesky climate-change research -- and the National Marine Fisheries Service it oversees will lose 17 percent of its funding. This despite Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross's desire to ''try to figure how we can become much more self-sufficient in fishing and perhaps even a net exporter.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As the three of us consider this statement, a common wry fisherman's response comes to our lips: Yeah, good luck with that, buddy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Because of repeated sacrifices made by American fishermen working with NOAA over the past 40 years, the United States now has the most robust and well-managed wild fisheries in the world. Federal observers oversee 80 percent of the large trawlers fishing for pollock, ensuring that this largest of fisheries maintains an impeccable set of management tools.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But in spite of all of our success, only around 9 percent of the seafood available in American markets comes from American fishermen. In fact, the last traditional fishing communities in the United States are fighting for their very existence. Fair-trade local fishermen remain unable to compete in our domestic marketplace, which is overwhelmed and flooded with cheap, untraceable imported seafood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  More than half the imported seafood here comes from fish farms, mostly in Asian countries, where there is little regulation of food safety. The rest, which is wild, is often from illegal sources. Rates of seafood fraud and deceptive mislabeling in the domestic marketplace are soaring to unprecedented levels.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Which government agency is at the forefront of combating this fraud? NOAA. Any funding for NOAA programs that help consumers reconnect to clean, healthy, sustainable seafood swimming off our shores is funding that we cannot afford to lose. The costs of managing our wild fisheries will not disappear with budget cuts; instead, the financial burden for programs like federal at-sea monitoring will continue to shift onto the shoulders of the last remaining American fishermen.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And it's not just wild American seafood that risks disaster. Aquaculture, the fastest-growing food sector in the world and one of the most promising new industries in the United States, will be crippled by President </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> budget cuts. The United States already ranks 17th in world aquaculture production, behind Myanmar. Yes, sad! Without NOAA, things would be even sadder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Most Americans probably think NOAA focuses on the weather. It does, but it does much more. NOAA gave birth to domestic shellfish farming in the 1930s and continues to fund innovations like seaweed and land-based salmon farming, which has in turn opened up new horizons for unemployed fishermen and their children. In Rhode Island alone, oyster growers raked in more than $4.3 million and have swelled their ranks by over 20 percent. And if revival of the blue-collar economy is the goal, according to the World Bank, building a network of seaweed farms covering a piece of ocean less than 5 percent of American waters could generate up to 50 million new jobs globally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The president's budget also zeros out Sea Grant programs, which provide education and technical assistance for aquaculture and other ocean-based industries. In the last two years these programs generated $575 million in economic impact and created or sustained over 20,000 jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  For those who work at sea, economic opportunity is inextricably tied to environmental protection. An Environmental Protection Agency initiative to reduce nitrogen and phosphorus pollution, now on the chopping block, has been the catalyst for more than 500 new ocean farms in the Chesapeake Bay in the last five years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Last, for everyday Americans who need fish for good nutrition, particularly school-age children, endangering the supply of clean, traceable, healthy American seafood risks our very future. It is estimated by the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization that pregnant women who eat eight to 12 ounces of seafood per week bear children with better brains and eyes, and I.Q. scores 5.8 points higher than the children of mothers who did not eat the recommended amount of seafood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Cutting NOAA's budget is a bad idea, both for parents who want their children to realize their full potential and for a president who wants to keep eating his favorite sandwich. And if all that fails to convince, consider this: NOAA tracks storms and wave heights, allowing thousands of fishermen to work safely. Without adequate funding, many could find themselves literally lost at sea.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PARIS -- Back in February, President </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> spoke at a conservative convention about a friend named Jim, a ''very, very substantial guy'' who ''loves the City of Lights'' but does not go there any more because ''Paris is no longer Paris.'' Maybe Jim should consider coming back.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">And Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> himself, who coldly tweeted two days before the first round of France's presidential election that the latest terrorist attack would have ''a big effect'' on the vote and told The Associated Press it would help Marine Le Pen of the far-right National Front, should also consider visiting France. He needs to get to know it better. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On Sunday, Paris still being Paris, Ms. Le Pen did not even reach 5 percent of the vote in the City of Lights. Campaigning on a nationalist, anti-globalization, anti-immigration platform, she made it into the second round with 21.3 percent of the vote nationwide, according to official final results that reported her achieving a better showing in rural and small-town France than in the cities.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  She was outpaced, though, by Emmanuel Macron, a 39-year-old political upstart who won 24 percent of the vote despite having never held elected office; his movement, En Marche! -- Onward! -- has existed for less than a year. He scored best in the cities, where urban, educated voters embraced his pro-Europe, open-borders, progressive agenda.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  To New Yorkers and Londoners, this strong territorial divide may look familiar. There are undeniable echoes of the Brexit-</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> 2016 electoral insurrection in this first round. France is not immune to the powerful populist wave that has engulfed Western democracies over the past few years, starting with Hungary and Poland.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Here, anger over inequality and unemployment, resentment over globalization and immigration, and discontent with a political system that has run its course contributed to a notable statistic: Of the 11 candidates who competed on Sunday, eight were either critical of the European Union or squarely against it. Together they attracted 49.6 percent of the vote -- almost half the electorate.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Yet the French vote has confirmed a trend apparent in recent elections in two other European Union member states, Austria and the Netherlands: Across the Channel from Britain, the dikes are holding. In all three countries, anti-populist forces managed to put forward a candidate or a platform offering an alternative innovative enough to counter the anger. In Austria, it was an ecologist presidential candidate. In the Dutch parliamentary election, it was two small, firmly pro-European parties. In France, it was a young man who portrayed his lack of political experience as an asset and promised to transform the discredited system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Let's face it: Old Europe is looking more resilient than the Anglo-Saxon world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the end, in France, neither Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> nor Vladimir Putin -- who ostentatiously welcomed Ms. Le Pen at the Kremlin a month before the election -- had a decisive influence on the election. Nor did the Islamic State. What mattered was Europe. This remains the major issue, superseding all others because so much depends on it now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  For Marine Le Pen's supporters, the European Union is an abomination that violates national sovereignty and opens borders to mass immigration, while the eurozone prevents the French government from controlling its economic and monetary policy. To Mr. Macron, the European Union is the institution that can help France be a player and defend itself in a globalized world, while its open borders and common currency increase economic opportunities for its citizens. Basically, Europeans are stronger together.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  This is the clear choice French voters will face in the second round on May 7. A choice between two starkly different visions of Europe, between two opposite outlooks on the world: an open world versus a world of borders and barriers, modernity versus conservatism. The political consensus, based on the European project and liberal values, that allowed two major mainstream parties to govern France alternately on the right and the left for the past three decades has been shattered.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The candidate of the governing Socialist Party, Beno&icirc;t Hamon, earned a devastating 6.4 percent of the vote, mirroring a trend in some other European countries. As for Les R&eacute;publicains, the center-right party, it is also in deep trouble. Their candidate, former Prime Minister Fran&ccedil;ois Fillon, came in third on Sunday with 20 percent. Never before had the major party of the right been eliminated from the second round.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Would the party have fared better with a candidate who hadn't employed his wife in lucrative but elusive tasks and who paid for his own suits? Even this is not sure, such is the thirst for renewal and the furor of ''d&eacute;gagisme'' (''scram-ism''), as the far-left candidate Jean-Luc M&eacute;lenchon, who claimed 19.6 percent, called the anti-politician trend -- only to fall victim of it, too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  This is the new landscape, shaped by the steady rise of the National Front and euroskepticism over the past decade. Rather than hiding behind it, Emmanuel Macron chose early in his campaign to fly the European flag. He astonished his rivals by winning support for the European Union, against all odds, at his rallies. And it worked.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He also managed to reverse the fear factor: By the end of the campaign, polls showed that more than two-thirds of French voters, still convinced of the benefits of a common currency, did not want to leave the eurozone, throwing Marine Le Pen's anti-euro agenda off balance. Mr. Macron embraced the French-German relationship, so vital to a unified Europe, and went to Berlin to meet Chancellor Angela Merkel, for whose immigration policy Marine Le Pen has only scorn.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Here is Mr. Macron's toughest challenge in the next two weeks: how to reconcile an electorate that has grown more conservative and fearful of the effects of globalization with the idea that a stronger Europe is congruent with France's interests and will not harm the country's national identity. His frequent use of the words ''protection,'' his rousing calls to ''patriots,'' the French flags waving alongside the blue European banner with its gold stars at his rallies while supporters join him in singing ''La Marseillaise,'' show that he is aware of the danger of leaving the monopoly of patriotism to the National Front.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But even if he succeeds on May 7, he will still be left with other difficulties. Winning the June parliamentary elections -- without a proper party -- and achieving a majority to govern is one. Transforming the political system, as he has promised, to adjust it to the 21st century and give a voice to those voters who have felt excluded for so long is another. For a political novice, however talented and lucky, this is quite a tall order. But it is the condition for the dikes to continue holding up.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Re ''Voters Embrace Outsiders in Election to Lead France'' (front page, April 24): </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  While it is encouraging that Emmanuel Macron leads Marine Le Pen by significant margins in almost all polling done to date, I cringe when recollecting the smug assurances the media and pollsters gave us that Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would never win the election here in the United States. Let's hope it's not another ''Whoops!'' moment when we all read the news on May 7.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  To the Editor:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The outcome of the first round of the French presidential election, in which Emmanuel Macron and Marine Le Pen finished first and second, exposes a serious flaw in the French voting system. France uses runoff voting: In the first round, each voter votes for a single candidate, and (unless a candidate gets more than 50 percent) the two candidates with the most votes face each other in a runoff.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  According to most polls, the third-place candidate, Fran&ccedil;ois Fillon, would have easily defeated Ms. Le Pen in a head-to-head contest. Thus, the fact that she -- not he -- has made it through to the runoff is a perversion of democracy. This occurred because Mr. Macron and Mr. Fillon -- both centrists -- split much of the first-round vote, enabling the far-right Ms. Le Pen to beat out Mr. Fillon for second place.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  France could avoid such anomalies by replacing runoff voting with majority rule, in which each voter ranks the candidates, and the winner is the one whom a majority of voters prefer to each opponent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  American elections would also benefit from this system. But that's a story for another day.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It can be done: You can close loopholes, lower taxes and be revenue-neutral. We did it in the Tax Reform Act of 1986.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  We lowered the top corporate tax rate from 48 percent to 34 percent and at the same time projected a $140 billion increase in business tax revenues over five years by closing loopholes on corporations and wealthy individuals.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  We used that money to lower taxes on individuals from a top rate of 50 percent to 28 percent. And we took six million low-income families entirely off the income tax rolls.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  To the Editor:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Unless Americans want to ''starve the beast'' further, they should be chary of so-called ''tax reform'' and ''tax simplification.'' They can become a slow-motion Trojan horse.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Over the years, many of the reforms and simplifications of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 have been repealed outright or just eroded, without even a pretense of maintaining revenue neutrality. Over the long term, tax reform has become a vehicle for ratcheting down the amount of money available for public purposes. At the same time, our tax system has become increasingly inequitable.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Legislation that lacks strong mechanisms to defeat tax termites that undermine the structure and to prevent clandestine revenue losses should either be amended or defeated.</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Re ''For Tax Reform, Just Keep It Simple,'' by Steve Forbes, Larry Kudlow, Arthur B. Laffer and Stephen Moore (Op-Ed, April 19):</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As one who considers himself a liberal and usually votes Democratic, I nevertheless find myself in full agreement with the writers' proposal to reduce the corporate tax rate to 15 percent, and to allow capital investment to be fully deducted in the first year of expenditure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I have been a chief financial officer of two venture-backed companies, and I know that every dollar of profit in small businesses goes right back into the business. Enactment of this proposal would further innovation, growth and jobs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I am also enthusiastic about the infrastructure investment proposal. With these two ideas, President </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has an opportunity to get Democrats and Republicans on board, and fulfill his campaign promises on growth, tax reform and infrastructure.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But I would add one caveat: Keep the tax rate at 35 percent for profits used to pay dividends or buy back stock. In the past 10 years, American corporations have spent trillions of dollars in buybacks and dividends, stunting growth while enriching shareholders and mediocre executives. This came at the expense of workers, long-term company health and the American economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Adding this provision will provide incentives to executives and their shareholders to invest for growth.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  MICHAEL TWOMEY, AUSTIN, TEX.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  To the Editor:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In case the writers haven't noticed, big business in America has been racking up record profits. It is small businesses that need the benefit from tax relief. So unless Republicans are intent on bestowing a grand entitlement on big business at the expense of our grander deficit, wouldn't it make sense to target all tax relief, including the deduction of the full cost of capital purchases and reduction in the tax rate, exclusively to small businesses? And we should ensure that small businesses are given priority in all contracts for infrastructure improvement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Targeting tax relief to where it is most needed may avert a deficit increase and would be more likely to spur growth from the bottom up rather than hoping and praying for it to trickle down.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BALKH, Afghanistan -- The Afghan defense minister and the army chief of staff both resigned on Monday as the government faced mounting pressure over a Taliban sneak attack that killed more than 160 soldiers last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The resignations, followed by broad reshuffling of the army's regional leadership, came as the American secretary of defense, the former Marine general and Afghanistan veteran Jim Mattis, arrived in Kabul for his first official visit in his new post. The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> administration is reviewing its Afghanistan policy and considering a request from the American military commander in the country for thousands of additional American troops to help the Afghan forces hold the line against a resurgent Taliban. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Afghan defense minister, Gen. Abdullah Habibi, and the chief of staff, Gen. Qadam Shah Shahim, said in a joint news conference that their decision to step aside was because of widespread anger at the attack against the 209th Army Corps in northern Balkh Province -- the single deadliest Taliban assault of the long war against Afghan forces.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In that assault, on Friday, 10 attackers drove onto the country's largest base in the north disguised as soldiers carrying wounded comrades. Some of them detonated explosives among hundreds of unarmed troops who were emerging from Friday Prayer, while others went on a rampage, gunning down soldiers, most of them new recruits in training.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  American military officials said on Monday that they had intelligence that showed the Haqqani network, a ruthless wing of the Taliban based in Pakistan that has become an integral part of the insurgency's leadership, was behind the attack. One senior United States military official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence, said the attack had been planned over four to six months and was too sophisticated and ''calculated'' to have been conducted by other branches of the Taliban.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The resignations of President Ashraf Ghani's defense secretary and army chief came as no surprise, American officials said, because they came on the heels of another devastating attack in March. In that assault, militants entered the Afghan Army's main hospital in Kabul and killed more than 50 people in a siege that lasted nearly seven hours and was claimed by the Islamic State.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Ghani, American officials said, had to show that there was some degree of accountability in his government. But Mr. Ghani, in fact, stepped in to protect the defense minister when Parliament was trying to oust him after the hospital attack.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Gen. John W. Nicholson, the commander of the American-led war effort in Afghanistan, said that while the Islamic State claimed responsibility for the hospital attack in March and the Taliban claimed responsibility for the base attack last week, military officials were watching for ''convergence'' between the two groups in Afghanistan. The style of attacks, General Nicholson said at a news conference with Mr. Mattis, was similar, and he added that it was ''quite possible that Haqqani'' was responsible for the base attack last week.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Afghan president's office said that Mr. Ghani and Mr. Mattis were meeting ahead of the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> administration's decision on whether to increase the number of American troops in Afghanistan, which General Nicholson has asked for. Mr. Mattis said he had not yet decided whether he would recommend a troop increase.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  American Defense Department officials have said that one option under consideration would be to send 3,000 to 5,000 additional troops to Afghanistan. But the open-ended commitment that some military experts believe is required of the war here would mean that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> would be backing away somewhat from his ''America First'' stance that he took during the presidential campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  General Nicholson's request for more American troops came after the Afghan government again missed much of its winter goal to urgently overhaul the security ranks in order to put up a stronger fight against the Taliban, who overran large parts of the country last year and now threaten several cities.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The aging top layer of commanders and generals of the Afghan forces is widely seen as corrupt. And there are rising concerns that the overreporting of troop and police strength, allowing commanders to line their pockets with pay for nonexistent ''ghost'' soldiers, has partly obscured a deep problem with high attrition and desertion rates.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At the urging of the American military leadership, Mr. Ghani finally set up a board to monitor senior security appointments and institutionalize promotions based on merit and away from political patronage. But a couple months in, the board seems in disarray.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On Monday, the president's office confirmed that Mr. Ghani had also replaced the commanders of four army corps, including the 209th. But officials and analysts said the appointments amounted more to an emergency reshuffle than any sign of effective change.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Saleh Mohammad Registani, an Afghan military analyst, said the forces still lacked a proper procedure to track the performance of officers. The senior appointments, he said, are made based on political considerations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ToloNews, the Afghan television channel, reported that the commander of the 209th Corps, Gen. Mohmand Katawazi, had been listed for retirement months ago, but Mr. Ghani had extended his tenure to lead the biggest army corps in the north.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''You have a young force full of energy but led by a cadre that is old and not experienced in this kind of battle,'' Mr. Registani said. ''When you speak to soldiers, they say even battalion commanders don't come to the battle, let alone the brigade or regiment leadership.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Just an hour after news broke that he had been replaced as the commander of the 209th corps, General Katawazi was seen driving to the airport in Balkh Province in a black armored vehicle with an escort of army ranger trucks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The hatred of the ranks for the leadership was clear when one of the police officers at the airport checkpoint was told the man in the black armored vehicle was the army corps commander who had just been replaced.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Replaced?'' the police officer shouted. ''Ashraf Ghani should hang him from the blades of a moving helicopter!''</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">When Amtrak's new chief executive took responsibility for two recent train derailments at Pennsylvania Station in New York, it was a low point for a railroad already confronting a series of urgent challenges.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Commuters have long complained that the station is overcrowded and dreary, but now Amtrak had acknowledged that its tracks were in poor shape and not being properly maintained. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The derailments have set off alarms over Amtrak's management of the station, its safety record and the railroad's perennial funding problems. The  days of commuting turmoil prompted by the accidents also offered an ominous preview of the future if the railroad's aging infrastructure is not soon overhauled.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Today, Amtrak finds itself at a crossroad: Is the 46-year-old national railroad at the cusp of a new era of investment as it pushes to build a train tunnel between New York and New Jersey -- one of the country's largest infrastructure proposals -- or will service deteriorate to levels that could damage the economy in the corridor between Washington and Boston?</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Northeast Corridor, the nation's busiest rail region, faces a $28 billion backlog of repairs needed to modernize equipment that 750,000 riders rely on every day, both on Amtrak and on the commuter rail lines that share the same tracks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Without major investments, the kinds of recent upheavals that have upended the lives of hundreds of thousands of travelers will be difficult to avoid, said Rosabeth Moss Kanter, a professor at Harvard Business School.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''If a bridge collapses, would people say, 'Oh, sorry, that just proves we shouldn't invest in bridges'?'' she said. ''No, they'd fix it.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   Mounting Challenges</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But Amtrak, a favorite punching bag for Republicans, could face major cuts under President </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. His budget proposed eliminating federal funding for Amtrak's long-distance routes and would slash a grant program that Amtrak was counting on to build a new Hudson River rail tunnel. Yet many long-distance routes traverse parts of the country that voted for Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, including the City of New Orleans line, which runs between Chicago and New Orleans.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At the same time, Amtrak has been under increased scrutiny after two fatal train crashes in the last two years. A derailment in Philadelphia in 2015 killed eight people. Federal officials blamed the engineer, who lost track of his location on the route, for the crash and said safety technology not yet installed on the tracks could have prevented the accident. A crash last year killed two workers when a train hit construction equipment on tracks near Philadelphia.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Then there is the fragile infrastructure at Penn Station, North America's busiest train station. The recent derailments closed several tracks, leading to cancellations and delays across the three railroads that share the station: Amtrak, New Jersey Transit and the Long Island Rail Road.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On April 14, a New Jersey Transit train became stuck in the Hudson River tunnel for hours, setting off another round of delays and harsh words between Amtrak and Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, who had already threatened to halt his state's payments to the railroad as a result of the earlier derailments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Charles W. Moorman, a freight rail veteran who was named Amtrak's chief executive in August, said the railroad had been ''chronically underfunded'' at a time when ridership on the railroads that use Penn Station had gone ''through the roof.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The number of trains and the number of people going through there are double what they were years ago,'' Mr. Moorman said in an interview. ''You've had this place where we weren't putting enough money in while the demand was growing.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The derailment on April 3 happened after weak timber ties allowed rails to push apart. Amtrak knew that the ties needed to be fixed and planned to do the work this year, but did not realize the seriousness of the situation, Mr. Moorman said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Amtrak has struggled, amid competing demands, to schedule maintenance work at the congested station, Mr. Moorman said. Not only must the railroad coordinate track closings with other railroads, but it also has to juggle the needs of bigger projects like building a new train hall in the James A. Farley Building across from Penn Station, a plan important to Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''What we have to do is work with these folks and make sure that we prioritize correctly,'' Mr. Moorman said. ''Clearly, my priority is to make sure we do the work so this kind of thing doesn't happen again.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  To address safety concerns, Amtrak and the Federal Railroad Administration are inspecting all of the track infrastructure at Penn Station. Mr. Moorman also said he would lead a review of Amtrak's maintenance practices and its engineering departments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  There were 178 derailments on Amtrak from 2010 to 2016, and 73 of the accidents, or 41 percent, were a result of track problems, according to federal statistics. Still, despite recent high-profile accidents, the number of derailments at Amtrak has remained relatively flat in recent years. There were 22 last year, down from 79 in 2000.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   A Rocky History</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Ever since Amtrak was created in 1971 to bring together many ailing rail lines, it has struggled to become profitable. It now carries more than 31 million riders annually, up from about 22.5 million in 2000. More than a third of Amtrak's trips take place on the Northeast Corridor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Federal subsidies to Amtrak, which reached a high of $1.7 billion in 1999, have remained relatively flat in recent years even as its needs have grown. Last year, Amtrak requested about $1.8 billion from the federal government, but wound up getting about $1.4 billion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Scrapping for federal funds has been a constant theme. In 2005, President George W. Bush proposed cutting Amtrak's federal subsidy to zero. President Ronald Reagan once called the railroad a ''mobile federal money-burning machine.'' Critics say that the federal government should not have to keep the railroad afloat and that routes should be sold to private companies or run by the states.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  For much of Amtrak's history, a tight budget has forced it to make difficult choices between spending on maintenance or new equipment, said John C. Spychalski, professor emeritus of supply chain management at Pennsylvania State University.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It's existed hand-to-mouth, patchwork to patchwork, to a great degree,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Amtrak's top priority now is building a new tunnel under the Hudson River to increase capacity and allow for repairs to the existing century-old tunnel, which was badly damaged by Hurricane Sandy in 2012. The tunnel is part of a broader slate of proposed upgrades, known as the Gateway program, that could cost nearly $24 billion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> budget, however, could jeopardize the tunnel plan  by drastically reducing a grant program, known as New Starts. Under President Barack Obama, federal officials and Amtrak agreed to finance half the tunnel project while New York and New Jersey agreed to pay the other half. A large piece of the federal funding was expected to come from New Starts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In an interview with The New York Times this month, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> refused to say whether he would support the Gateway tunnel. But Mr. Christie, a Republican who once led Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> transition team and backs the tunnel plan, said recently that he had discussed the project with Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I've spoken personally to the president about the project many times, and I am absolutely convinced that the president understands the importance of the project,'' Mr. Christie told reporters. ''I've seen him talk about this and say that it's the most important infrastructure project in the country.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Still, Mr. Christie held a news conference recently alongside Senator Cory Booker, a Democrat from New Jersey, to urge the new federal transportation secretary, Elaine Chao, to visit New Jersey to see the tunnel's crumbling walls for herself. A spokeswoman for Ms. Chao said that was on her to-do list.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Amtrak's inspector general's office issued a 71-page report in March detailing the railroad's many challenges, including upgrading its train fleet, which is an average of 27 years old. The report noted that trains were often delayed by freight traffic on rails Amtrak pays to use across the country. Amtrak owns much of the Northeast Corridor, but nationally about 72 percent of the miles traveled by Amtrak trains are on tracks owned by other railroads.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  An Uncertain Future</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Amtrak's decision to hire Mr. Moorman, a former chairman of Norfolk Southern, a freight rail operator, was widely praised. After earning millions of dollars in his previous job, Mr. Moorman declined to accept a salary and says he simply wants to help.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It is a big catch to get a major, experienced, well-respected private sector rail operator,'' said Ms. Kanter, the Harvard Business School professor. ''That adds a lot of credibility.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, said Amtrak's recent problems might prompt Congress to offer more support for the railroad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The most vexing thing here, that really is just troubling, is this could have been prevented,'' Mr. Schumer said in an interview, referring to the derailments.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In a letter to Congress in February 2016, Amtrak's last chief executive, Joseph H. Boardman, warned that the railroad's ''outdated and inadequate infrastructure'' must be replaced. After nearly eight years on the job, Mr. Boardman called once more for higher levels of federal investment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The letter was prescient.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''My successor, if he or she is fortunate enough to spend as many years in this position as I have, will not have much time,'' he wrote, ''to reverse current trends before they adversely affect our performance and the economy.''</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">BYLINE: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">By BEN BRANTLEY</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">SECTION: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">Section C; Column 0; The Arts/Cultural Desk; Pg. 1</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c5"><SPAN CLASS="c7">LENGTH: </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">1328 words</SPAN></P>
</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The amnesiac title character of ''Anastasia,'' who may or may not be the long-lost daughter of the last Russian czar, isn't alone in suffering a serious identity crisis. The postcard-scenic show that bears her name, which opened on Monday night at the Broadhurst Theater, has its own troubling case of multiple personality disorder.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Come to think of it, Anastasia the person, played by Christy Altomare, has it easy compared with ''Anastasia'' the musical. She has to worry only about whether she's really a princess. And judging by her instinctive poise, commanding condescension and cut-glass accent, she can't be in that much doubt, though she does sometimes go all wobbly when ghosts of the Romanov Empire dance around her. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The show in which she appears trembles nonstop with internal conflicts during its drawn-out two-and-a-half hours. Part of the source of its malaise may be detected in a conspicuous credit below the title in the program that reads, ''Inspired by the 20th Century Fox motion pictures.''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That's pictures, plural, not picture, and they too were titled ''Anastasia.'' One of them, from 1997, was an animated spectacle with talking animals and a resurrected Rasputin; the other was the dignified, soapy costume drama from 1956 starring that most uncartoonish of actresses, Ingrid Bergman, who won a welcome-home Oscar for it after her exile from Hollywood.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Anastasia'' the musical, which features a book by the acclaimed playwright Terrence McNally and songs by the Tony-winning team of Stephen Flaherty and Lynn Ahrens (who all collaborated on ''Ragtime''), shifts between the worldviews of both inspirations, while pretending there's no disconnect. In the process, it evokes another kind of show altogether.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I mean those mid-20th-century musicals that must've sounded like a good idea at the time, but tend to be remembered today only by hard-core aficionados of the genre. They were frothy but earnest shows, set in distant times and foreign lands, with titles like ''Mata Hari'' and ''Pleasures and Palaces.'' Such shows had a hard time squeezing their epic-size selves into the corsets of book-musical conventions, and they usually died young.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I don't foresee a similar fate for ''Anastasia,'' which originated at Hartford Stage in Connecticut and is directed by Darko Tresnjak (a Tony winner for his ingenious staging of ''A Gentleman's Guide to Love &amp; Murder''), with choreography both stately and antic by Peggy Hickey. The cartoon version from 1997 is very fondly remembered by people who saw it as tweens, especially girls.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Its Ahrens-Flaherty score included the breakout hit ''Journey to the Past,'' which is repurposed here and sung ardently by Ms. Altomare. So ''Anastasia'' may well tap into the dewy-eyed demographic that made ''Wicked'' such an indestructible favorite of female adolescents. Those without such nostalgic insulation are likely to find this ''Anastasia'' a chore.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It is a reminder, among other things, that bloody periods of history, like the Russian Revolution, do not naturally lend themselves to perky song and dance. (Yes, I know, I know -- there are the stunning exceptions of ''Les Mis&eacute;rables'' and ''Miss Saigon,'' but would anyone ever describe these grim behemoths as perky? And ''Hamilton'' is its own animal.)</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It's a challenge not to wince, for example, during the unspooling of a plot that segues from the execution of the Russian royal family to plucky comic numbers about hard times in the newborn Soviet Union. No, the death-dealing firing squad doesn't sing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But a con man who remembers more glamorous days does, mournfully recalling: ''I hobnobbed with the royals/ But then a change of luck./ The czar was dead, the royals fled, and comrade, now we're stuck!'' The one reminiscing is the unctuous, middle-aged Vlad (John Bolton, looking embarrassed), who comes up with the scheme of passing off a promising impostor as Anastasia, Nicholas II's youngest daughter, who is rumored to have survived the firing squad.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Vlad and his good-looking young partner in deception, Dmitry (Derek Klena), take up the pretty street sweeper, Anya (Ms. Altomare), who has lost her memory. They train her in aristo ways in a wan ''My Fair Lady''-style tutoring session. (Never have I so missed ''The Rain in Spain.'')</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The three sneak out of Russia, after a sentimental choral farewell to their homeland. (Never have I so missed ''Anatevka'' from ''Fiddler on the Roof.'') Their destination: Paris, where the dead czar's mother, the Dowager Empress (the ever-elegant Mary Beth Peil, whom it's always nice to see, even in a show like this), lives in gloomy exile.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Will the empress accept Anya as Anastasia? If so, what will happen to the budding romance between Dmitry and Anya, who have one of those cutely combative relationships that are so popular in animated films?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Fans of the 1997 movie may be disappointed to learn that its archvillain, Rasputin, and his winged assistant, Bartok the bat, have been banished from the show. Their replacement is a humorless but handsome apparatchik, Gleb (Ramin Karimloo, a veteran of grand operas, looking embarrassed), who finds himself strangely drawn to Anya. He follows her to Paris, with designs both romantic and homicidal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Other characters include the wacky Countess Lily (Caroline O'Connor, of Baz Luhrmann's ''Moulin Rouge,'' trying hard), the former mistress of Vlad. Reunited, these two make like sexed-up variations on the roguish old lovers played by Maurice Chevalier and Hermione Gingold in ''Gigi.'' (Never have I so missed ''I Remember It Well.'')</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Alexander Dodge's sets, fleshed out by photographic projections by Aaron Rhyne, have a pop-up book prettiness, though they often seem stranded between two and three dimensions. So do the performances, though Ms. Altomare commits herself to her part with melodramatic focus and a soaring pop voice.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Once she switches from her street-sweeper rags into Parisian haute couture (the costumes are by Linda Cho) you may discern a resemblance to that current fashion plate of American royalty, Ivanka </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Trump.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> I did anyway. Such are the little self-diverting games a constant theatergoer plays when the mind wanders.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- To be clear, it isn't that hard to keep the government's lights on.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Fights over short-term spending bills have long been used by Republicans and Democrats as proxies for broader policy fights. But with Republicans fully in control of Washington, President </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has turned a sure thing into a major drama, with a Friday night deadline before much of the government shuts down. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Congressional appropriators, always happy to spend money together, seemed on a glide path to do so, until Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> intervened, insisting on using the bill to get a down payment on a wall at the Mexican border that even many Republicans are leery of and that he has long insisted would be paid for by Mexico. He appeared to soften his demand late Monday, saying he would settle for additional funds for border security -- potentially including at least part of the wall, according to a senior administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Suddenly, a spending bill that was meant to be a mere legislative grace note to much larger health care and tax policy bills has become the centerpiece of another down-to-the-wire battle.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The Wall is a very important tool in stopping drugs from pouring into our country and poisoning our youth (and many others)!'' Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said Monday on Twitter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The president's habit of tossing hornets into Republican policy picnics has hampered his agenda and demonstrated the lack of experience among his staff in working with Capitol Hill to get things done. His lack of early engagement on the health care bill helped lead to its demise, and his early efforts at a tax bill were disorganized -- he announced he had one even though critical staff members and congressional leaders knew nothing of it. Those stumbles and his current flirtation with a government shutdown demonstrate a continued pattern of playing to his base rather than governing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Democrats -- whose votes will be needed to pass any spending bill -- and plenty of Republicans have no interest in building a wall, certainly not in paying for it with a short-term spending bill. ''Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> threw a monkey wrench with the wall,'' said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader. ''We believe that the Republican leaders should tell Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that we can do this at a later time.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On Monday, as senators returned to Washington from a two-week recess to confirm Sonny Perdue for secretary of agriculture, Republican congressional leaders were negotiating with White House officials, who have been pressing for wall funding and a mechanism to take some funding from the Affordable Care Act.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Later Monday, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> told reporters from conservative news outlets that he was willing to compromise by pushing the deadline for the border wall funding to this fall, if he cannot get all of it now, according to the senior administration official.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The House returns on Tuesday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is hardly the first president to fight with his party over major policy matters. President Jimmy Carter's fights with fellow Democrats over nearly everything prompted Senator Edward M. Kennedy to challenge him for the party's nomination in 1980. President Barack Obama fought with coal-state Democrats who sunk his climate change bill and with war-weary members of his party over whether to launch airstrikes in Syria.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The general dynamic to get congressional leaders aligned with the White House is often a challenge, but rarely impossible,'' said Patrick Griffin, a former aide to Senator Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia and a legislative director during President Bill Clinton's first term. ''This dynamic is only different in that the president is so unpredictable. What should be obvious is not a certainty.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Counterproductive as his moves may appear, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is clearly eager for a victory, and funding for his wall would be one, at least with his base. His negotiating method appears to be to join the conversation late and pressure Congress via his beloved Twitter account, with references to campaign promises that were always long shots.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The president is not beholden to the same constituencies as previous Republican presidents,'' said Ken Spain, a former spokesman for the National Republican Congressional Committee. ''That was a major asset for </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> as a candidate, but from a governing perspective it can lead to competing priorities with the more conventional wing of the party.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Spain added, ''To the extent the White House and Republicans on Capitol Hill can utilize a hand-in-glove approach, the likelihood for success increases dramatically.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  While many presidents bring advisers from their home state during their first term, they also tend to staff up with people wise to the ways of working with Congress. But like Mr. Carter's, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> inner circle is particularly full of close associates who have not spent time in Washington, and have learned the hard way -- at the hands of lawmakers, often from their own party -- about what is and is not possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''They learn Congress is a coequal branch of government,'' said former Senator Trent Lott, Republican of Mississippi and a onetime majority leader. ''What Congress has to do and the Senate majority leader has to do is say to the president of their own party sometimes is, 'We appreciate your interest, but we are not going to do that here today.'''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Indeed, Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, warned the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> administration soon after the election that the best course of action was to accept a spending bill that would have gotten the government through the rest of the fiscal year without the bill's being slowed or sidelined by tax and health care legislation. His counsel was not heeded.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Democrats support increased border spending, just not a wall. ''Let us all recognize that we have a responsibility to protect our borders,'' said Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House minority leader. ''The fact is that the wall is a dereliction of duty in doing that.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As such, it is likely that Congress will try to come up with a bill that can please both parties and include new funding for the border with vague promises to work on the wall issue later in the year. To get to that point, it is also likely that a very short-term spending measure will have to be passed on Friday as a bridge to a final spending bill.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  However, should Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> dig in, there could be a huge and largely needless fight that distracts from the rest of his agenda. ''It is not going to happen in this bill, so I am not sure why they are making a sweat over it,'' Mr. Lott said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''This is one of the places where they need to get this done, and it's easy,'' he added. ''They have to do health care and a tax bill and appropriations so that they can turn later this year to infrastructure. Because if they don't have health care and tax reform, there is going to be hell to pay at the next election.''</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Markets Up on French Election News, </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> Tax Report </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  All three major U.S. indicies were up more than a percent on Monday. News out of France that the moderate Emmanuel Macron was headed for a runoff with Marine Le Pen sent shares of many companies up early. And a report from The Wall Street Journal that President </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> wants to cut the corporate tax rate to 15 percent added momentum to the rally.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  French Election Gives Euro Relief</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The euro has been given a shot in the arm.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The currency was up more than 1 percent against the dollar on Monday, after Emmanuel Macron and Marine Le Pen advanced to the second round of the French presidential election.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The optimism has carried over to other markets. Bond yields in France and Italy were down, and the Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index looked set to open higher Monday morning after rallies in Europe. The French benchmark index, the CAC 40, was up about 4.5 percent. -- AMIE TSANG</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Klaus Kleinfeld Off the Board of Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Too</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It wasn't hard to see this coming. A week after Klaus Kleinfeld was ousted from Arconic for sending the billionaire hedge fund manager Paul E. Singer a bizarre letter, his professional world continues to fall apart. First, he lost his job as chief executive of Arconic. Then, he was booted off Morgan Stanley's board of directors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Now, he's off the board of Hewlett Packard Enterprise, too. In a regulatory filing, HPE said Mr. Kleinfeld stepped down on Sunday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  What to Watch For: Halliburton and Barrick Gold Earnings</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &acirc;-&nbsp; The energy and construction firm Halliburton beat earnings expectations, sending its shares higher. The Canadian gold mining company Barrick Gold also reports on Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  &acirc;-&nbsp; Don't forget to read the DealBook newsletter.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Jimmy Choo Puts Itself Up For Sale</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The luxury shoemaker Jimmy Choo said on Monday that it was seeking offers as part of a strategic review.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The move comes two and half years after Jimmy Choo went public on the London Stock Exchange and could lead to a large payout for its largest shareholder, JAB Luxury, which owns 67.7 percent of the company.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  JAB Luxury is part of JAB Holding Company, which owns Krispy Kreme and Keurig Green Mountain and which recently agreed to buy Panera. JAB Luxury said it was supportive of the review.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Shares of Jimmy Choo rose 5 percent in early trading in London on Monday after the announcement. -- CHAD BRAY</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Travis Kalanick, the chief executive of Uber, got a telling off from his counterpart at Apple, Timothy D. Cook, in 2015.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Uber had been tracking iPhones even after its app had been deleted from the devices and the iPhones themselves had been erased. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The practice broke privacy rules at Apple, which insists that wiping an iPhone should ensure that no trace of the owner's identity remains.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Cook told Mr. Kalanick that if Uber did not stop the tracking, the Uber app would be kicked out of the App Store, a move that would deny access by to millions of iPhone customers, potentially destroying the ride-hailing service's business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Kalanick acceded and his company survived.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The episode is an example of how, time and again, Mr. Kalanick has openly disregarded rules and norms, backing down only when caught.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Along the way, his efforts to succeed regardless of the cost have created a company culture that has dragged Uber into its most sustained crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The New York Times has examined how Mr. Kalanick's approach of asking for forgiveness rather than permission and relentlessly pursuing goals at other people's expense has at times put his ride-hailing company on the brink of implosion.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The AT&amp;T Juggernaut</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As far as AT&amp;T is concerned, it is just a humble telecommunications company, wanting to buy an entertainment business.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In a world where megasize media companies are buying each other up, AT&amp;T is the underdog -- or at least, that's what AT&amp;T wants everyone in Washington to understand.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In some parts of the country, however, that argument seems to be undermined:</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   In Nashville and in Louisville, Ky., AT&amp;T has been suing to make it harder for broadband providers to use utility poles;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   In Missouri, Tennessee and North Carolina, the company has been pushing for laws that block municipal broadband providers;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   And in San Francisco, it has been pushing back at efforts to open up apartment buildings to more internet service providers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Those actions are among those that may affect the Justice Department's review of the company's deal to buy Time Warner.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Antitrust officials may have a hard time buying AT&amp;T's argument that it will expand broadband competition and not seek to harm competitors if they find the company is actively working to block new broadband players from entering the markets AT&amp;T already dominates,'' said Gene Kimmelman, the president of Public Knowledge, a consumer group. Mr. Kimmelman is a former senior antitrust official at the Justice Department, and he opposes the merger.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  AT&amp;T denies being hypocritical. It says that in the examples cited, it was trying to fight misguided and potentially illegal regulations, while protecting jobs and the quality of its service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Coming Up</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">   This could be the week when a long-promised tax cut for Americans is unveiled. President </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said on Friday that a ''massive'' cut would be announced on Wednesday, but gave no further details. Treasury officials seemed to have been taken by surprise by the president's declaration and had little more to say about it, so the announcement may be about a broad outline rather than a detailed plan.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Tax experts say that any overhaul would have to get rid of certain deductions for business if it is not to starve the Treasury. The main roadblock, though, comes from a sector that the president knows well: the real estate industry.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ben Bernanke is worried.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The former chairman of the Federal Reserve, who can offer his thoughts freely now that he is three years out of office, is not anxious about the objective, actual state of the economy. Rather, he is worried that Democrats and Republicans view the health of our nation completely differently. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  To Democrats, things look dour indeed. To Republicans, things are rosy and looking better all the time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''There is this kind of partisan coloring,'' Mr. Bernanke told me last week in a rare interview while on a trip to Manhattan from Washington, where he lives.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It is really striking,'' he said. ''The election result completely reversed people's views of the state of the economy. Republicans who thought that we were in a dystopia now think things look great, and Democrats, the opposite. And it shows that it isn't all based on an objective assessment of the economy.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Bernanke's assessment is supported by recent research: A series of new surveys and polls show direct evidence that your politics increasingly define your view of the economy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Just this month, the University of Michigan's monthly survey of consumer sentiment diverged in an unprecedented way: Republicans are convinced that the economy is surging, while Democrats are concerned about an imminent recession.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  To Mr. Bernanke, when the economy -- as well as the basic statistics that undergird it -- becomes politicized, the result is bad policy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''A lot of the emotion is not really susceptible to nuanced policy arguments,'' he said, shaking his head.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Bernanke has been thinking recently about the current state of politics and the economy. Although he left the Federal Reserve in 2014 (''It's a lot more relaxing to be in the civilian world,'' he said), he recently had to a write an afterword for the paperback version of his book ''The Courage to Act,'' which is expected to come out in two weeks and chronicled his time at the Fed and captured his thinking during the financial crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That exercise forced him to try to think through the implications of economic policy in an age of populism. And while wages may be stagnant for many, and some industries are shedding jobs, Mr. Bernanke is convinced that much of the country hasn't appreciated just how good the economy is.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The U.S. has done so much better than most of the rest of the world,'' he said. ''I mean if you have an international perspective and you travel around the world, then you hear from policy makers or average people in other countries: 'Boy, the U.S. is doing great. We wish that Europe or Japan could do as well.'''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Still, Mr. Bernanke acknowledged that his view might appear to be one of a globalist or member of the elite.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I fully acknowledge that doing well on the whole doesn't mean doing well for everybody, and there are a lot of people who have been left behind or have not done as well as the average,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That unevenness, he said, has led to much of the populism sweeping the globe.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I think a lot of the populist reactions in the world, perhaps even more so than in the United States, is against immigration, which reflects cultural anxiety,'' he said, explaining that he believes part of the country is asking, ''Are we becoming a minority in our own country?''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He said he was struck by a recent economic paper by Anne Case and Angus Deaton of Princeton University looking at the high mortality rate among white men with only a high school education.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Clearly there is very substantial stress among a large part of the population,'' Mr. Bernanke said. ''Some of it is cultural-social, and I'm not really an expert on those things. Some of it is economic inequality, disruption from trade and technology, slow productivity growth, which means slow wage growth.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Bernanke, who was always a careful speaker when testifying to Congress, was mostly circumspect when it came to directly commenting on President </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. A rare moment of direct commentary came when the conversation turned to tax policy and some of the ideas the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> administration has floated.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''In tax policy, corporate tax reform could be helpful if it stimulates capital investment, but as a practical matter it doesn't look like major reform is very likely,'' he said, brushing aside Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> claims that a tax code overhaul is imminent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We might have lower tax rates, maybe balanced to some extent by closing some loopholes, that would be a better policy,'' Mr. Bernanke said. ''I don't think it's going create a productivity miracle or anything like that, but it would be more efficient. It would probably improve investment a little bit.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And while Mr. Bernanke was intrigued by the notion of a border adjustment tax, he was skeptical of this, too.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I think politically it seems very unlikely to happen,'' he said. He added that it was ''a really interesting idea, and it's based on some very careful thinking about the tax code.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The biggest headwind it faces, he said, is ''there is not much confidence that the dollar would appreciate by 25 percent'' -- which would be required to make the math work -- and ''the import industry sees it as a big threat to their profits, so it'll be highly contested.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And what about Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> infrastructure plans?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I think there is scope for smart infrastructure investment to be helpful,'' Mr. Bernanke said, contending that it might make the country more productive by lowering the time people spent in traffic, for example.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He has also been following the debate about repealing Dodd-Frank and the seemingly similar calls by Gary Cohn, the head of the National Economic Council, and Senator Elizabeth Warren to bring back some version of Glass-Steagall, which would separate commercial and investment banking. (At the same time, Mr. Bernanke made an unpopular -- though accurate, in my view -- argument: ''I don't think the repeal of Glass-Steagall was a very important factor in the financial crisis.'')</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Then, with a smile, Mr. Bernanke turned into a political analyst: ''I think the idea that Gary Cohn and Elizabeth Warren agree on this may be a little bit overstated.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He said: ''I think the Republican perspective, which I assume Gary Cohn is thinking about, although I don't know, is to go back to the old world before the crisis, where you had free-standing investment banks and importantly, from the perspective of the free-standing investment banks, they weren't controlled. They weren't regulated by the Fed. They didn't have any of the bank regulation.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On the other hand, he said, ''I think the left or Democratic view of Glass-Steagall is we're going to break up these universal banks, we're going to reduce their political power, but we're not going to deregulate -- we're going to make all the components subject to tough supervision.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Finally, he said he had been thinking about the potential for robots to take our jobs and upend the economy, something that he thinks should be watched.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''You have to recognize realistically that A.I. is qualitatively different from an internal combustion engine in that it was always the case that human imagination, creativity, social interaction, those things were unique to humans and couldn't be replicated by machines,'' he said. ''We are coming closer to the point where not only cashiers but surgeons might be at least partially replaced by A.I.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That could be a problem for Democrats and Republicans alike.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The draft of the Financial Choice Act 2.0, released last week by the House Financial Services Committee and aimed at overturning much of the Dodd-Frank Act, contains provisions that could change how the Securities and Exchange Commission polices the markets.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Unlike similar legislation introduced last year by Representative Jeb Hensarling, Republican of Texas and chairman of the committee (which had zero chance of success with President Obama in office), the new draft may find a receptive audience with the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> administration, and may result in Congress curtailing enforcement of securities laws. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At first glance, the new draft appears to have teeth. To address the theme of being tough on Wall Street, a favorite rhetorical target of both parties, the legislation would increase the maximum penalties the S.E.C. can impose for violations, including a top corporate fine of $10 million per violation. It also adds a fourth tier of penalties that triples the fine for recidivists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But whether higher financial penalties will have any appreciable effect is an open question, especially for companies earning billions in profits that may view a few million dollars as a trivial reprimand.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  What's more, another provision would require the S.E.C. to determine if a corporate penalty will harm shareholders. That could discourage large fines by allowing opponents of corporate liability to claim that innocent investors will be stuck paying the price.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Apart from increased penalties, the legislation will restrict the S.E.C.'s ability to file administrative cases before its in-house judges and instead point them toward a Federal District Court. Defendants named in an administrative proceeding would have the right to require dismissal of the case; the S.E.C. could then refile the charges in a federal court, but that would give defendants much broader power to discover evidence and a right to a jury.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  If the defendant elects to have the case stay in front of an in-house judge, the S.E.C. will have to prove its case by clear and convincing evidence. A federal court requires proof only by a preponderance of the evidence, making it even less likely that the administrative process will be used in a contested matter: No litigant wants a more difficult burden of proof when a lighter one is available.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The measure also would prevent the S.E.C. from barring someone found guilty of violating securities laws from serving as an officer or director of a publicly traded corporation. Only a federal district judge could order that sanction, another reason to channel cases into the federal courts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  All told, while an in-house proceeding would not be precluded, it would be a much less enticing avenue for pursuing enforcement of securities laws.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The attack on administrative proceedings is a reaction to a provision of the Dodd-Frank Act that authorized the S.E.C. to pursue a wider range of penalties in cases filed with its own judges, which is usually a more expeditious procedure. The shift away from federal courts in some cases resulted in howls of protests from defense lawyers that the S.E.C. was depriving their clients of important rights while giving itself an unfair home-court advantage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Whether there is in fact that much of an advantage in an administrative proceeding is an open question. A Wall Street Journal article in 2015 claimed that the S.E.C. won a much higher number of cases in front of its own judges than when it went into federal court.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But Professor Urska Velikonja, a visiting faculty member at Georgetown University, disputes that contention in an article published recently in The Washington Law Review. The article was based on an empirical study showing that the S.E.C. was victorious in 88 percent of the cases in federal district courts while winning 90 percent in front of its own judges, a minuscule difference.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A decision last week may show that the home court isn't always an advantage. An S.E.C. administrative judge ruled in favor of a defendant in an insider trading case, the type of charge once brought only in federal court before the Dodd-Frank Act. The judge said that the agency had not shown that the information came from an insider, and recommended that the charges be dismissed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Congress could simply repeal the provision of the Dodd-Frank Act expanding the use of administrative proceedings, but the legislative proposal takes a more circuitous route to make them far less useful in a contested case. It seems that anything related to the Dodd-Frank Act is anathema to Republicans in Congress, regardless of whether it actually gives the S.E.C. an advantage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Another provision could allow defendants sued by the S.E.C. a means to challenge charges by claiming they had not been informed in advance of the theory of liability being pursued. The legislation would preclude an enforcement action ''if such person did not have adequate notice of such law, rule or regulation'' and require the S.E.C. to publish a statement or guidance about the violation ''prior to the time that the person engaged in the conduct that is the subject of the enforcement action.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One goal of the 2016 legislation discussed in a committee analysis was to prohibit the S.E.C. from using ''unproven legal theories'' to establish a violation. A provision in that proposal would have required the S.E.C. to establish a process to ensure that enforcement actions did not exceed its legal authority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The recent draft is not limited to new theories of liability but appears to require the agency to explain all of its interpretations of the law to ensure that defendants have the requisite notice. Nor could the agency simply explain its interpretation in a policy statement: These interpretations would have to follow the laborious notice-and-comment procedures for adopting regulations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The notice provisions could give defendants an avenue to challenge the S.E.C.'s application of the law in a wide range of cases, raising issues about whether its explanations were sufficiently broad and how clear they have to be when frauds come in almost infinite permutations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The S.E.C. enforcement division's pursuit of a case would also be affected by the legislative proposal. A new enforcement ombudsman would be appointed to serve as a liaison between the staff investigating a case and the persons under scrutiny to provide assistance ''in resolving problems such persons may have with the commission or the conduct of the commission staff.'' Complaining about staff conduct could become a routine tactic, subjecting the investigation to additional scrutiny before it is resolved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Another provision would give people the right to appear in person before agency staff members when a recommendation has been made to file an enforcement action, and any of the five S.E.C. commissioners or one of their aides could attend the presentation. If, after an investigation, it is decided not to pursue a case after, the agency must adopt procedures to do that in a timely fashion and notify those involved that the investigation has been closed.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  If the measure is adopted, Congress would be inserting itself fairly deeply into the enforcement division's practices, reflecting a general mistrust of the S.E.C.'s decision-making process. That most likely signals a concern that the agency has been too aggressive, a typical complaint from Wall Street when it is the subject of the kind of crackdown that has occurred the past few years.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  By mandating greater access for those under the agency's scrutiny, the net effect may be to slow down cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  An interesting provision added to the legislation would require a study of the S.E.C.'s enforcement policies and practices; the results would be reported to the congressional committees that oversee the agency. Among the topics to be addressed would be how procedures comport with due process and how they protect investors while maintaining efficient markets, as well as a general review of case selection and the adequacy of sanctions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A thorough review of how the S.E.C. pursues enforcement has not been undertaken since 1972, when the Wells Committee, named for its chairman, John A. Wells, proposed numerous changes that continue in use today. Whether we might see a more radical restructuring of the enforcement process in the future is a possibility, especially if the Republicans in control of Congress remain skeptical of how the agency pursues cases.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Change is certainly in the air for the S.E.C. The question is whether it will be hamstrung by the Financial Choice Act 2.0 if it is adopted in its current form, and how effective it will be in policing corporate America.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LONDON -- There was palpable relief in mainstream Europe on Monday at the success of the independent centrist Emmanuel Macron in the first round of the French presidential elections, and a wide assumption that he will defeat the far-right Marine Le Pen in a runoff two weeks from now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After other recent electoral setbacks for far-right populists, and the far right's flagging momentum in Germany's election campaign, some even suggested that the French election could represent the high-water mark of the populist surge that has voted Britain out of the European Union and Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> into power in the United States. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  If this is a high-water mark, though, the water remains quite high.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  For the moment, the parties and personalities that have energized far-right populism have not fully crystallized electorally. But the issues that have animated the movements -- slow economies, a lack of jobs, immigration -- are not going anywhere, and the far right has already moved the political terrain in its direction.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The politics of Europe remain, at best, precarious, even if the center -- the French-German core of the European Union -- appears to be holding, at least for now.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''There is a sigh of relief,'' said Jan Techau, the director of the Holbrooke Forum at the American Academy in Berlin. ''It's good that in addition to all the other issues on the agenda, we don't also have an extremist French problem.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After a year of unpredictable elections in Europe and the United States, it would be unwise to discount Ms. Le Pen entirely, even if her odds are long. Still, the French result was particularly welcomed by Brussels and Berlin, which have been praying for a French partner willing to challenge both the statist structure of France and the complacency of the European Union. And after weeks of market jitters, investors on Monday cheered the results, with global stocks surging and the euro reaching fresh highs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Macron believes in economic liberalism, a reformed France and a more flexible European Union, while Ms. Le Pen threatens to take France out of the bloc, which would in effect mean breaking it over her knee.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, broke protocol to congratulate Mr. Macron and wish him continued success, as did the German foreign minister, Sigmar Gabriel, who said, ''He will be a great president.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  By winning more votes than Ms. Le Pen, Mr. Macron, who at 39 is on course to be France's youngest head of state since Napoleon, seemed to many to be a new generation's centrist answer to sclerotic and corrupt establishment politics and the challenge of populism and the far right.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Even so, candidates of the far right and far left did very well in the voting, reflecting strong and skeptical views among the French public.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Of course many people in Brussels and so on are relieved that we don't have two extremists in the last round, but only one,'' said Guntram B. Wolff, a German who directs Bruegel, a Brussels-based research organization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''But the fact of the matter is that we still have a little bit more than 40 percent of the electorate having voted for an extremist,'' Mr. Wolff said. ''So that shows that a large part of the French population doesn't seem to be very happy with his or her own position and pretty dissatisfied with the political system.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The question for many is whether a centrist reformer like Mr. Macron, a former investment banker, is prepared to seriously take on board the dissatisfaction of ordinary working people.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''That the flow of support towards the far-right populists has stagnated is a hopeful sign for European democracy,'' Ska Keller and Philippe Lamberts, the co-leaders of the Greens in the European Parliament, said cautiously in a joint statement.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''But the threat from the far right is not over,'' they were quick to add. ''If Macron is to take it on and defeat it, he needs to get real on social justice and do more for those who feel marginalized.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Still, for a majority in Europe, the far right has not provided answers either, as it has fallen short of predicted triumphs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In December, the far right was defeated narrowly in Austria's presidential election. In a parliamentary vote in the Netherlands in March, the nationalist Geert Wilders failed to come first as predicted, though he did finish second. In Britain, the U.K. Independence Party, or UKIP, which pushed for the country to exit the European Union, has lost its only member in the national Parliament and is floundering before the June 8 elections.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Perhaps most significant, with crucial German elections this September, the populist Alternative for Germany, which rode a wave of anti-Islam, anti-migrant sentiment to seats in 11 of the country's 16 state legislatures, seems to be running out of steam, mired in internal disputes.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Yet on traditional measures, Ms. Le Pen did very well in the first-round vote on Sunday. She received nearly 7.7 million votes, compared with her 6.4 million in the first round in 2012 and the 4.8 million that her father, Jean-Marie, received when he advanced to the second round in 2002.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  While Ms. Le Pen is expected to lose in the runoff, Mr. Macron -- as a youthful banker with an elite education -- is an easy target for her. French unhappiness with establishment parties is sure to be reflected in the June votes for the French legislature, in which Mr. Macron and his year-old movement, En Marche!, will have to work hard to cobble together a working majority.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Robin Niblett, the director of Chatham House, a research institute in London, cautioned that populist views have been growing for many years, not just in southern Europe but in ''more settled northern Europe,'' like Sweden, Finland and the Netherlands.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''In a time of economic turbulence, there's been a search for national identity and individual identity, a feeling that national identities are being stripped away at a pace people can't control,'' he said. ''The E.U. is seen as an expression of that loss, and even a vehicle for it.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As important, the far right's nationalism and opposition to multilateralism have split mainstream parties and pushed the national conversation to the right.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''At the moment, conservatives are doing a better job at coalescing support and co-opting aspects of the populist message,'' Mr. Niblett said. Each country has its own specific political context, he said, ''but I don't see the validity of the populist message declining.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Giles Merritt and Shada Islam of Friends of Europe, a research institution in Brussels, hailed Mr. Macron, saying that if elected, he ''would not only breathe new life into the Franco-German 'locomotive' but offer a more hopeful and upbeat message for the future.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Germany especially is looking forward to a more like-minded French partner, as together they make up about 47 percent of the eurozone's gross domestic product, said Daniela Schwarzer, the director of the German Council on Foreign Relations in Berlin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Macron understands Europe and the need to change things, and that means changing France, too,'' she said, noting a speech by Mr. Macron in Berlin that directly linked ''reform and modernization in France with reform in the E.U.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That is the perfect line for Germany, she said, ''which fears pressure for more burden-sharing with countries who haven't done their economic homework.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Macron has said he wants a common eurozone budget under a eurozone ''finance minister'' and has proposed ''democratic conventions'' to identify reform priorities for the European Union.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Germans fear that if the eurozone integrates further with a budget and banking union, but without prior economic changes from its members, Germany will end up bailing out everyone else forever. So Mr. Macron, vowing economic reform in France, is singing a song much more attuned to German ears.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But Mr. Macron, if elected, is also expected to push a harder negotiating line with Britain over its exit from the European Union -- especially on the issue of financial services, about which he knows a great deal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''With his background, we assume Macron sees much more clearly where the actual issues lie and will work to prevent Europe from facing a competitive disadvantage,'' Ms. Schwarzer said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But there is much to play for, not just in Britain's election in June but especially in Germany's in September. Chancellor Angela Merkel faces a strong challenge from the center-left Social Democrats, and the far-right Alternative for Germany is likely to win seats in the federal Parliament for the first time.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At the far right's party conference this past weekend in Cologne, there were strong themes of nationalism and distaste for immigration despite the party's internal disputes, in which Frauke Petry, one of its leaders, lost her effort to pull the party away from the hard right.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Her rivals brought delegates to their feet with speeches that pandered to identity loss. Whether or not the party succeeds, the issue seems likely to continue to resonate broadly.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  J&ouml;rg Meuthen, a professor who leads the party with Ms. Petry, said that few Germans could be seen as one walked around a typical German town.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''This is our country,'' he told cheering delegates. ''The country of our grandparents and parents. We must take it back.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">LONDON -- The euro has avoided another existential crisis that might have wreaked havoc on Europe and the global economy. That was the conclusion investors divined from the first round of voting in the French presidential election, prompting exuberant buying on markets around the world on Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Those in control of money looked beyond the fact that Marine Le Pen, a far-right candidate bearing intense hostility to the euro, claimed a spot in the second round of balloting on May 7. Instead, they focused on polls showing that she was likely to be defeated, and by a lopsided margin, at the hands of her sole remaining opponent -- Emmanuel Macron, a pro-European figure trusted by business leaders. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  For markets anxious about the prospect of a Le Pen presidency, it was as if a fire-breathing dragon hovering over the kingdom had been slain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Stocks on French exchanges surged to a nine-year high as a wave of relief washed over the commercial realm. The value of the euro climbed nearly 2 percent against the dollar before yielding some of those gains. The gap between interest paid on French sovereign debt and rock-solid German government bonds narrowed, an indication that investors were seeing diminishing risks. The optimism spread to the United States, with American stocks up more than 1 percent and investors selling off safe havens like Treasury bonds.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The manic swings of the markets -- first spooked by the possibility of a Le Pen presidency, then ecstatic over the apparent unlikelihood of that possibility -- attest to the gnawing fear that the euro could still succumb to whatever blow history delivers next. The euro confronts a chronic shortage of faith in its ability to persevere, along with a surplus of threats to its existence.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In recent years, the euro has survived enough Greek tragedy to fill an Aeschylus trilogy and has had sufficient brushes with Italian banks for an opera. It has endured a global financial shock, years of regional economic stagnation and no end of cross-border political accusations.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As Ms. Le Pen appeared to see her electoral fortunes expand in recent months, the markets construed yet another direct threat to the euro's sustainability.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Ms. Le Pen, the leader of the National Front party, has long disdained the euro as a threat to prosperity. She has pledged to convert French debt into a new national currency, an undertaking that could begin the euro's downfall. And she has vowed to renegotiate France's relationship with the European Union, threatening to upend the project of European integration that has prevailed on the Continent as an antidote to the brutalities of World War II.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Her strength in polls in recent weeks prompted investors to demand greater returns on French government debt, a sign that the odds of default -- however minute -- were multiplying. Investors had been aggressively purchasing options that offered protection against a precipitous plunge in the value of the euro.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Few gave credence to the prospect that Ms. Le Pen could actually deliver on her radical promises. Even if she were to shock pollsters and win, her party would almost certainly fall well short of claiming a majority in the French Parliament after legislative elections in June. She would be relegated to figurehead status, with governing handled by a prime minister selected by the party in command.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Still, concern in the markets underscored the fundamental defects that have long compromised the euro. It is a structurally flawed currency, one adopted by 19 nations -- known collectively as the eurozone -- that operate without a unified political organization.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Many argue that the euro was doomed from inception. It was conceived more as an idealistic reach for European cooperation than as a reasoned plan to manage a currency. The assumption was that shared money would spur greater European political integration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Instead, the euro has devolved into a major source of political acrimony across the Continent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In countries with their own money, bad economic times typically prompt governments to spend more to generate jobs and spur growth. Their currencies fall in value, making their goods cheaper on world markets and aiding exports.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But countries in the eurozone cannot fully avail themselves of those benefits. The currency comes with rules limiting the size of budget deficits. Faced with hard times, governments using the euro have been forced to intensify the hurt on ordinary people by cutting pensions and other public outlays.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Nobel laureate economist Joseph E. Stiglitz has indicted the euro as a leading source of economic inequality that has divided European nations into two stark classes -- creditor and debtor.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As Cyprus, Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain have slid into debt crises in recent years, they have accused Germany of self-serving inflexibility in demanding strict adherence to debt limits while refusing to transfer wealth to those in trouble. Germany and other northern countries have accused their southern brethren of failing to carry out changes -- like making it easier to fire workers -- that would make them more competitive.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The crises have time and again exposed the structural flaws of the eurozone, and its tendency to generate more recrimination than action.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''You have a basic situation in the eurozone now where it's like a half-built house,'' said Jacob F. Kirkegaard, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. ''As long as that persists, a large number of investors are going to have existential doubts about the euro.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The latest alarm was being set off by France, one of the euro's charter members, and a pillar of the European Union. This was playing out against a backdrop of destabilizing events that once seemed impossible -- the election of Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the United States and the vote in Britain to abandon the European Union, also known as Brexit.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Ms. Le Pen has moderated her positions recently as her election has gained plausibility, but her hostility for the European Union and the euro are well known. ''I want to destroy the E.U.,'' she told the German newsmagazine Spiegel in a 2014 interview. ''The E.U. is deeply harmful, it is an antidemocratic monster. I want to prevent it from becoming fatter, from continuing to breathe, from grabbing everything with its paws.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the same interview, she confirmed her desire to yank France free of the euro.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''If we don't all leave the euro behind, it will explode,'' she said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Ms. Le Pen has since muted talk of renouncing the euro in favor of adding a parallel currency, the franc. But the threatened act of redenominating French debt would almost certainly lead to a downgrade of France's credit rating, bringing severe market consequences, said Mujtaba Rahman, managing director for Europe at the Eurasia Group, a risk consultancy based in London.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Rahman traced a potentially calamitous string of events that could play out after a victory by Ms. Le Pen. Even before parliamentary elections, she could appoint a temporary government while serving notice that France intended to renegotiate the terms of its membership with the European Union.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Her room for maneuver is greater than people believe,'' Mr. Rahman said. ''She will have interpreted her election as a massive mandate. It flows from Brexit, it flows from </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, and she'll try to get as much of her agenda done while she is unrestrained.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Even if she is stymied by political backlash, she could cause a volatile reaction in financial markets. Around the globe, central banks, sovereign wealth funds and asset managers hold some 700 billion euros (about $760 billion) in French government debt. A Le Pen presidency could scare them into unloading some of it, increasing borrowing costs for the French government and the business world.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  French banks could see consumers pull euros out of their accounts to be saved elsewhere. If that became a bank run, the consequences could become global, given that France's four largest banks are deeply intertwined in the international financial system.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Most analysts dismiss such talk as apocalyptic. The French Parliament and Constitution would severely constrain a President Le Pen. Investors would grasp that. Still, in the run-up to the first round, the costs of protecting assets against government default grew in Italy, as well as in France.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The fear was that if Ms. Le Pen were to win the presidency, the risks would proliferate. That would increase the costs of borrowing for businesses and households in Italy, Spain and Portugal, impeding job creation and economic activity, while perhaps forcing governments to cut services.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  That could generate public anger, stoking the fires of populism as Italy goes to the polls early next year. Enhanced electoral prospects in Italy for the Five Star Movement, which favors scuttling the euro, could result.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In short, a victory by Ms. Le Pen would add momentum to Europe's crisis of confidence. It would inject greater dysfunction into European institutions, rendering them even less capable of alleviating economic troubles. And more strife has in recent times has translated into more support for the populist movements seeking to dismantle those institutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It would be devastating for the eurozone and the E.U. if she won,'' Mr. Kirkegaard said. ''It would certainly paralyze the eurozone in terms of almost anything for at least five years.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But on Monday, as stock markets exulted and the euro climbed, that possibility had seemingly been rendered hypothetical.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The euro -- perpetually afflicted by doubt -- had dodged the latest immediate threat to its permanence.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">''I am sad that I am not on television anymore.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">With those words, Bill O'Reilly broke his silence on Monday evening, addressing listeners for the first time since he was ousted from Fox News amid revelations that he and the network paid millions of dollars to settle allegations of sexual harassment against him by multiple women. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After 20 years as the king of cable news, Mr. O'Reilly's return to broadcasting came not on camera, but in a 19-minute recorded podcast on his personal website. At the outset, he acknowledged to his fans that this was ''a completely different experience than what you've had in the past.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I was very surprised how it all turned out,'' Mr. O'Reilly said of his forced exit last week from Fox News. ''I can't say a lot because there's much stuff going on right now. But I can tell you that I'm very confident the truth will come out. And when it does -- I don't know if you're going to be surprised, but I think you're going to be shaken, as I am.''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. O'Reilly said that he would record a current-events podcast on his subscription-based website, airing four nights a week, that he hoped would soon develop ''into a genuine news program.'' But he demurred on offering further details about his abrupt removal from the air.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I can't say any more because I just don't want to influence the flow of the information, O.K.?'' Mr. O'Reilly said. ''I don't want the media to take what I say and misconstrue it. You, as a loyal O'Reilly listener, have a right to know, down the lane, what exactly happened and we are working in that direction.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The re-emergence of Mr. O'Reilly, who was vacationing in Italy when Fox decided to dismiss him last Wednesday, came an hour before his successor at 8 p.m., Tucker Carlson, made his on-air debut in the time slot.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In a direct address to viewers, Mr. Carlson called himself a devoted O'Reilly fan who ''marveled at how prepared he was, how tough he was, and how crisply and directly he expressed his views.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''What O'Reilly did was not easy,'' Mr. Carlson said, just before the opening credits rolled. ''He set a high bar. I'm going to do my best to meet it. Thanks for sticking with us.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Carlson's debut marked a crucial first test of Fox News's hastily revamped prime-time lineup. The ensemble show ''The Five'' was moved from the afternoon to the 9 p.m. slot, featuring a new co-host, Jesse Watters, a former O'Reilly prot&eacute;g&eacute;.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Inside Fox News, there is still widespread unease about what the abrupt exit of Mr. O'Reilly means for the network. Without Mr. O'Reilly on the air, ratings at 8 p.m. last week dipped nearly 30 percent from his average for the first three months of the year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The network was also hit on Monday with a new lawsuit from a former anchor, Andrea Tantaros, who claimed that senior executives at Fox News spied on her and created an online campaign to harass her. The network denied all wrongdoing.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In a brief statement on the day he was let go, Mr. O'Reilly praised his former employer, and he restated that sentiment again Monday night. ''Look, I was there for 20 years and six months,'' he said on his podcast. ''That vehicle was fabulous for me, and I said in the beginning that I'm sad, but why wouldn't I wish them the best? They were there, we performed well for them, and that's the fact.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The podcast featured no guests, graphics or blaring headlines, and Mr. O'Reilly's usual I-know-best tone seemed softened, even plaintive at times. But elements of the usual O'Reilly attitude broke through.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He promoted his new book, ''Old School: Life in the Sane Lane,'' and talked up a planned national tour, listing four separate cities where he would soon be appearing (''Plenty of good seats remain''). He bashed the mainstream media, defended President </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Trump,</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and threw in a dig at Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, saying she ''could never get elected anywhere south of the Mason-Dixon line.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Back at Fox News, the pressure is on. Mr. O'Reilly was the linchpin of its evening lineup, with a loyal following that swelled to nearly 4 million viewers a night earlier this year. It was his best-ever viewership -- and a bountiful lead-in for his fellow anchors.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But last week, with Mr. O'Reilly off the network, ratings fell.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Network executives pointed out that, even without Mr. O'Reilly, ''The Factor'' was still attracting slightly more viewers than the year before. Still, last Friday's ''Factor'' drew 2.84 million viewers, less than that day's 5 p.m. edition of ''The Five'' and a 6 p.m. airing of Bret Baier's ''Special Report,'' according to Nielsen data.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Concerns about the treatment of women at the network also remain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Ms. Tantaros, a host who left the network last year, filed her lawsuit in Federal District Court in Manhattan on Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Among the listed defendants were Fox News's former chairman, Roger E. Ailes, and several senior-level executives at the company, including its co-president, Bill Shine.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  This is Ms. Tantaros's third lawsuit involving her tenure at Fox News. She sued Mr. Ailes and the network last year, saying that Mr. Ailes had sexually harassed her; that suit is currently in arbitration. She filed a separate suit last week in the State Supreme Court of New York, claiming that Fox News tried to undermine her credibility by instigating a derogatory Twitter post about her.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Monday's lawsuit states that Fox News hacked into Ms. Tantaros's digital devices and eavesdropped on her phone calls, as retaliation for her claims against Mr. Ailes. Ms. Tantaros says in the suit that a fleet of anonymous social media accounts, known as ''sock puppets,'' used the information to send her subtle and disconcerting signals that she was being watched.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The key question here is whether the Murdochs are serious when they say they want to usher in a new era at Fox,'' said Judd Burstein, Ms. Tantaros's lawyer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The network vigorously denied the accusations in a statement from its outside counsel, Dechert.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Fox News executives ''have no knowledge of the anonymous or pseudonymous tweets described,'' the statement said. ''This lawsuit is a flimsy pretext to keep Ms. Tantaros and her sexual harassment claims in the public eye.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Susan Estrich, a lawyer for Mr. Ailes, dismissed the new lawsuit as meritless and ''an obvious attempt to get publicity,'' adding: ''The courts and the parties should not be burdened by repeated filings such as this.''</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">PARIS -- A day after mainstream parties were dealt a heavy defeat in the French presidential election, the far-right leader Marine Le Pen, one of the two candidates to advance to a runoff, condemned the parties' calls to unite against her and support her rival, the independent centrist Emmanuel Macron.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Ms. Le Pen's statement on Monday denouncing ''the old and completely rotten Republican Front'' -- the coalition of mainstream parties allied against her -- sums up her challenge in the May 7 runoff. So far, not a single rival party has called for its voters to support Ms. Le Pen. And she has no plausible major reservoir of votes to add to the 21.3 percent she received in the first round of voting, though she is expected to gain some voters from the defeated center-right candidate Fran&ccedil;ois Fillon. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Perhaps in an effort to broaden her appeal to voters from outside the far-right National Front's traditional constituencies, Ms. Le Pen announced on Twitter on Monday that she was temporarily stepping down as the party's leader so she could run as a candidate for ''all the French.''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Tonight, I am not the president of the National Front, I am the presidential candidate, the one who wants to gather all the French around a project of hope, of prosperity, of security,'' she said in an interview on French television.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Most of Ms. Le Pen's rivals have gathered around the effort to defeat her. Only one major candidate has resisted calls to unite against her: Jean-Luc M&eacute;lenchon, the firebrand hard-left candidate who came in fourth and who has pointedly refused to support Mr. Macron, saying instead that he would seek the opinion of his supporters through his website. Similarly, traditionalist Roman Catholic organizations that backed Mr. Fillon refused to endorse Mr. Macron on Monday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Some of Ms. Le Pen's advisers said, in interviews with French news media on Monday, that they were hoping to lure some of the supporters of the defeated Mr. M&eacute;lenchon, whose populist program bore similarities to that of Ms. Le Pen: hostility to the European Union, NATO and the forces of globalization, and a forgiving attitude toward Russia's president, Vladimir V. Putin.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Many of Mr. M&eacute;lenchon's supporters may have little fondness for Ms. Le Pen, but in interviews they expressed equal disdain for the pro-free market Mr. Macron. ''For me, Le Pen, Macron, it's the same,'' said Olivia Scemama, a musician from the 18th Arrondissement of Paris who said she voted for Mr. M&eacute;lenchon. ''With Macron, it's the extremism of banks, of finance.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The election results published Monday suggested another hurdle for Ms. Le Pen to overcome: a sharp urban-rural divide in the vote, with voters in France's major cities heavily favoring her rivals. The geography and sociology of her support was similar to Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> support in the 2016 United States presidential race. She won more d&eacute;partements -- between a county and a state in French political geography -- than Mr. Macron, and she won the working-class vote. But she did poorly in what French sociologists call ''Winner's France'' -- urban, employed, well-educated and pro-European. She received less than 5 percent of the vote in Paris, less than 8 percent in Bordeaux and less than 9 percent in Lyon.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Stock markets opened higher on Monday across Europe, a sign that investors were relieved by Mr. Macron's strong showing. Ms. Le Pen wants France to leave the euro currency zone, a prospect that created unease on international markets in the prelude to the first round of voting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Polls released Monday showed that about 60 percent of voters supported Mr. Macron, compared with less than 40 percent for Ms. Le Pen. A live televised debate between the candidates is set for May 3.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In H&eacute;nin-Beaumont, the northern French city where Ms. Le Pen won 46 percent of the vote and whose National Front mayor is one of her top advisers, even supporters were pessimistic about her chances in the runoff. ''It's a bummer,'' said Jean-Louis Devienne, 72. ''If people could come here and see how good the National Front has been for our town, they would understand how good it can be for our country.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On Monday, Ms. Le Pen continued to emphasize the anti-immigrant and anti-globalization views that propelled her into the second round, and she denounced the efforts of the mainstream parties to keep her out of the presidency.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The old and completely rotten Republican Front, which no one wants, and which the French have pushed away with exceptional violence, is trying to coalesce around Mr. Macron,'' Ms. Le Pen said in Rouvroy, a town in the deindustrialized north of France where her message tends to resonate with voters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Ms. Le Pen also called Mr. Macron ''weak'' on terrorism, an issue that drew renewed attention days before the first round of voting, when a gunman on the Champs-&Eacute;lys&eacute;es, in central Paris, killed a police officer.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  President Fran&ccedil;ois Hollande is scheduled to pay tribute to the fallen officer at a ceremony on Tuesday. His office said that Mr. Macron and Ms. Le Pen are expected to attend.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Macron, who has never held elective office, came in first among 11 candidates, with 24 percent of the vote. Ms. Le Pen was second, with 21.3 percent, according to final results tallied Monday by the Interior Ministry.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Fillon, the center-right candidate who was once seen as the front-runner, before a scandal involving public funds paid to his family, finished third at 20 percent. He was followed by Mr. M&eacute;lenchon at 19.6 percent, and the Socialist candidate, Beno&icirc;t Hamon, at 6.4 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The mainstream parties were left struggling to pick up the pieces after their poor showing. On the right, many were quick to blame their candidate, Mr. Fillon, who refused to drop out of the race after the embezzlement scandal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Socialists and the Republicans will now be looking to elections in June, when French voters will elect the members of the National Assembly, France's lower and more powerful house of Parliament. Those legislative elections could present a bigger challenge for Mr. Macron than winning the second round of the presidential election. He has vowed to field candidates in all 577 districts. But his political movement is barely a year old, and he is up against the established parties, which are weakened but still have extensive networks.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Although Mr. Macron is seen as an overwhelming favorite in the second round of the presidential election, he was warned not to take victory for granted and -- after he spent Monday night with supporters at a chic restaurant in the wealthy Sixth Arrondissement of Paris -- not to celebrate too much, too soon.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- The annual Holocaust remembrance ceremony at the Capitol is typically a noncontroversial event. But Tuesday's commemoration is fast becoming a rallying point for critics who accuse the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> White House of courting white nationalists and playing down the suffering of Jews.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In his first three months in office, President </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has found himself at the center of recurrent and at times bewildering controversies surrounding his relationship with Jews. His daughter Ivanka is a convert to Judaism and is raising her children Jewish. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  This month, Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, said that Adolf Hitler had not used chemical weapons against his own people, though Mr. Spicer later apologized profusely. And in a news release for Tuesday's event at the Capitol, the White House copied, nearly word for word, language posted on the website of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, which is sponsoring the commemoration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Some Jewish groups have already expressed concern about the White House chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, who was accused by a former wife of making anti-Jewish comments, and his deputy, Sebastian Gorka, who has been accused of links to far-right groups in Europe. The criticism goes back to the 2016 presidential campaign, when </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> supporters fired anti-Semitic attacks at his opponents and at journalists viewed as hostile to his candidacy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> himself came under fire during the 2016 Republican primary campaign when he was slow to denounce the former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The latest controversies have done nothing to reassure concerned Jewish groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I've struggled with whether or not I should even go, or to stay away in protest,'' said Andrew J. Weinstein, a member of the museum's board of trustees who was appointed by President Barack Obama. Ultimately, he decided to attend, ''despite my deep concerns about the president and the people he's surrounded himself with.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''But there are many, many reasons not to,'' said Mr. Weinstein, a Florida lawyer and Democratic fund-raiser.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is expected to speak Tuesday at the Capitol during the museum's Days of Remembrance ceremony.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On Sunday night, in a video shown to the plenary session of a World Jewish Congress event in New York City, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> gave his most extensive remarks so far about the atrocities of the Holocaust as evidence of his ''passion'' on the topic, what he called ''the darkest chapter of human history.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We mourn, we remember, we pray and we pledge: never again. I say it, never again,'' Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said in the video. ''The mind cannot fathom the pain, the horror and the loss. Six million Jews, two-thirds of the Jews in Europe, murdered by the Nazi genocide. They were murdered by an evil that words cannot describe, and that the human heart cannot bear.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  He added: ''We must stamp out prejudice and anti-Semitism everywhere it is found. We must defeat terrorism, and we must not ignore the threats of a regime that talks openly of Israel's destruction. We cannot let that ever even be thought of.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The event was not a heavy lift for Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> -- he and the group's president, Ronald S. Lauder, are longtime friends. Matthew Brooks, the executive director of the Republican Jewish Coalition, nonetheless pointed to the video as a chance for critics to ''take a moment and listen to what he has to say.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''There's no question that right now the professional class of complainers are going to find whatever reason they want to criticize and take issue with anything the president does. The fact of the matter is, I think he should strongly be applauded,'' said Mr. Brooks, whose organization is heavily backed by the casino magnate Sheldon G. Adelson.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Brooks said that Tuesday's appearance at the Capitol is a chance for Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to put the ''absurd'' notion that he is ''soft on anti-Semitism'' to rest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Could some things have been said somewhat differently'' during the campaign, Mr. Brooks asked, answering, ''Yes.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But others said that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> appearance amounts to too little, too late. More than 2,500 people signed an open letter, within the first hour of its posting, to support a request by Bend the Arc Jewish Action asking the Holocaust museum to withdraw its invitation to Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">. Others went on Twitter to urge their followers to call the museum to register their protest.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and his administration have embraced the rhetoric and the agenda of white nationalism,'' said Stosh Cotler, the chief executive of Bend the Arc Jewish Action. ''This is not someone who deserves the platform of speaking at a national day of remembrance of the Holocaust.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The museum said that since it opened in 1993, every president has participated in the Days of Remembrance. But Ms. Cotler said that ''Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is not an ordinary president because of his demonization of immigrants, scapegoating of religious minorities, denigration of the press and attacks on the judicial system and the very foundations that maintain our free and democratic country.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  One board member who asked not to be identified said that board members from both political parties planned to skip the ceremony in silent protest of what they saw as repeated violating of the norms of tolerance by Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- After their already shaky start, it is hard to imagine Republicans would want to top off a chaotic first 100 days of unified government control with a disruptive federal government shutdown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">But that astounding scenario remains a live possibility this week as lawmakers and the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> White House have so far been unable to agree on a plan to fund the government beyond Friday despite months of staring at the hard April 28 deadline. It is an unsettling but not unfamiliar position for congressional Republicans who have forced government closings in the past and know well that they will be assigned the brunt of the blame if federal agencies are shuttered yet again. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Should a shutdown occur, this one would have a defining new wrinkle. The politically charged spending fights that closed the government during the Clinton and Obama administrations were the product of clashes between congressional Republicans and a Democratic White House in a sharply divided Washington. Today, Republicans control both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue, and allowing the federal government to go dark on their watch might be hard to explain.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Our Republican colleagues know that since they control, you know, the House, the Senate and the White House, that a shutdown would fall on their shoulders, and they don't want it,'' said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Republican leaders from President </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on down insist they are determined to avoid a shutdown and will be successful in doing so. Failure would put a bizarre exclamation point on the symbolic 100-day marker that the administration coincidentally will reach Saturday.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''No one wants a shutdown,'' Sean Spicer, the White House spokesman, told reporters on Friday. ''We want to keep it going.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Republicans have good reason for doing so considering that history shows the party image takes a beating with the public when government agencies lock their doors, national parks refuse visitors and federal workers are told not to report to work. Democrats, while not victorious in special House elections held so far, have shown renewed strength, and a shutdown in the early days of Republican stewardship of Washington would only fuel their energy.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The spending drama is the first </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">-era clash in which minority Democrats have real leverage, and they intend to use it to stop the White House and congressional conservatives from pushing through spending that Democrats oppose, such as money for a wall on the southern border.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Lawmakers, who have been negotiating for weeks to try to reach a compromise, say they were steadily progressing until the White House in recent days began taking a more aggressive posture, insisting that Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> wanted at least a down payment on the construction of a border wall that was central to his successful presidential campaign.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Elections have consequences,'' Mick Mulvaney, the former House conservative who is now the head of the Office of Management and Budget, told The Associated Press in an interview. He offered Democrats a deal: The administration would support continued subsidies for millions of people receiving health insurance through the Affordable Care Act in exchange for Democrats agreeing to the initial wall funding.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Schumer called that proposal a nonstarter. Other Democrats suggested they saw no reason to accept that offer because Republicans are separately but simultaneously trying to unravel the health care program. They also believe that if White House refusal to fund the subsidies caused a collapse of the health insurance market, Republicans would get the political blame for that upheaval, as well.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Though a shutdown would most likely inflict significant political damage on Republicans, Democrats say they, too, want to keep the government running because shutdowns are costly, reckless and shake both public and international confidence in United States institutions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But they also say that if the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> administration and Republican leaders on Capitol Hill want to engage in a nasty political fight and shut the government down in a fit of pique over funding a border wall that even some Republicans do not back, then they are welcome to it. Both sides expect that if the impasse cannot be quickly breached, Congress will most likely extend current funding by a week to allow more time for a deal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The question for Democrats is whether the White House is bluffing on its border wall demands so that the administration can later tell Republican voters that they pushed as hard as they could to get the money, particularly with so little to show legislatively for Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> first 100 days besides the confirmation of a Supreme Court justice, Neil M. Gorsuch. Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is the wild card -- would he shut down the government to prove he will not relent on his demands? And would Republican leaders stand with him?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Democrats have been on the sidelines while Republicans pushed through </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> nominees, rolled back federal regulations and sought unsuccessfully to disassemble the health care law without consultation with the minority party. But the appropriations process is a different animal.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Not only do Republicans need Democratic help because some Republicans in the House and Senate refuse to vote for any spending bills at all, but Republicans are also likely to need 60 votes in the Senate to overcome Democratic objections. And Senate Democrats have proved over the past two years that they are able to remain united and stymie Republicans on spending bills if they do not agree with what Republicans put forward.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, has said repeatedly that Democratic votes will be required to avert a shutdown. Mr. McConnell has also acknowledged previously that the Republican Party ''owns the government shutdown brand.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It's not a good brand,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Democrats do not agree with Mr. McConnell on much, but they do on that last statement. And that will strengthen their confidence in the quickly approaching showdown.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">After sending more than 13,000 Twitter messages in less than three years, Jon Feere, an outspoken opponent of illegal immigration, suddenly went silent after Inauguration Day.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">As a legal policy analyst at the Center for Immigration Studies, a Washington-based group that favors significant reductions in immigration, Mr. Feere had staked out tough positions on the subject, including pushing for an end to automatic citizenship for children born in the United States. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Feere's newfound reticence reflected not a change of heart but a new employer. He now works for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the agency tasked with finding and deporting people living in the United States illegally.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  His last Twitter post, on Jan. 20, read simply: ''It's time to make immigration policy great again.''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  It's time to make immigration policy great again. -- Jon Feere (@JonFeere) January 20, 2017</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  For years, a network of immigration hard-liners in Washington was known chiefly for fending off proposals to legalize the status of more people. But with the election of a like-minded president, these groups have moved unexpectedly from defense to offense, with some of their leaders now in positions to carry out their agenda on a national scale.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We've worked closely with lots of people, who are now very well placed in his administration, for a long time,'' said Dan Stein, president of the Federation for American Immigration Reform, another hard-line group.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Julie Kirchner, who served for a decade as executive director of the organization, also known as FAIR, is now working as an adviser to the commissioner of Customs and Border Protection. Kellyanne Conway, before she was known for campaign work and spirited defenses of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on cable television, worked regularly as a pollster for FAIR.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> senior White House adviser, Stephen Miller, worked tirelessly to defeat immigration reform as a staff member for Senator Jeff Sessions, now the attorney general. Gene P. Hamilton, who worked on illegal immigration as Mr. Sessions's counsel on the Judiciary Committee, is now a senior counselor at the Department of Homeland Security, the parent agency of the Border Patrol and ICE, where Mr. Feere is working. Julia Hahn, who wrote about immigration for Breitbart -- with headlines like ''Republican-Led Congress Oversees Large-Scale Importation of Somali Migrants'' -- has followed her former boss, Stephen K. Bannon, to the White House as a deputy policy strategist.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Daniel Tichenor, an immigration politics scholar at the University of Oregon, called it ''highly unusual'' in the post-World War II era to have proponents of sharply reduced immigration in such high-ranking positions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''You would have to go to the 1920s and 1930s to find a comparable period in which you could point to people within the executive agencies and the White House who favored significant restrictions,'' Mr. Tichenor said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Their influence is already being felt. Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> is known for his sound-bite-ready pledges to deport millions of people here illegally and to build a border wall, but some of the administration's more technical yet critical changes to immigration procedures came directly from officials with long ties to the hard-line groups.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  These include expanding cooperation between immigration agents and local law enforcement officials; cracking down on ''sanctuary cities''; making it more difficult for migrants to successfully claim asylum; allowing the Border Patrol access to all federal lands; and curtailing the practice of ''catch and release,'' in which undocumented immigrants are released from detention while their cases plod through the courts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Although his proposed budget slashed $1 billion from the Justice Department, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> included $80 million to hire new judges to accelerate deportation proceedings. Mr. Sessions said at an event at the border in Arizona this month that 50 would be added to the bench this year and 75 more next year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> has put together the people who are taking this thing down to the operating-instruction level,'' Mr. Stein said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Even those who have labored for decades to scale back immigration did not expect such a dramatic change. ''This is inconceivable a year ago,'' said Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies. ''Frankly, it's almost inconceivable six months ago.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  When Mr. Feere asked him for a leave of absence to work on the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> campaign, Mr. Krikorian said he granted it without necessarily expecting it to lead anywhere. ''Honestly, I didn't think that would pan out,'' he said, but recalled telling Mr. Feere, ''Look, you know we've always got a job for you if it doesn't work out.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The groups' growing influence has also brought renewed scrutiny to their inflammatory statements and shared nativist roots. The Center for Immigration Studies, FAIR and another group, the grass-roots organizer NumbersUSA, all were founded or fostered in their early stages by the activist John Tanton, a Michigan ophthalmologist who had an outsize influence on the immigration debate through his organizing efforts.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Dr. Tanton came under sharp criticism for corresponding with white nationalists and for couching the fight to reduce immigration as a racial and demographic struggle. ''For European-American society and culture to persist requires a European-American majority, and a clear one at that,'' Dr. Tanton once wrote to a friend, elsewhere expressing his fear of a ''Latin onslaught.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Southern Poverty Law Center has been quick to point out how the Center for Immigration Studies has circulated articles ''penned by white nationalists, Holocaust deniers, and material from explicitly racist websites,'' and added the immigration center to its list of active hate groups. Mr. Krikorian has spoken out against the label, saying it served only to shut down legitimate debate on immigration.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Southern Poverty Law Center has long been especially critical of FAIR, which had in the past received money from the Pioneer Fund, a foundation that has financed research on the relationship between race and intelligence. Mr. Stein of FAIR rejected the attacks as politically motivated, prompted by the group's success in helping defeat an immigration overhaul in Congress.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  This month, FAIR filed a complaint with the Internal Revenue Service accusing the Southern Poverty Law Center of committing ''flagrant and intentional'' violations of its tax-exempt status by criticizing Republican candidates during the 2016 presidential race.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Richard Cohen, president of the Southern Poverty Law Center, said it never crossed the line into improper political activity. ''I think we have an obligation to expose hate not just in the dark corners of our society but also in the mainstream,'' Mr. Cohen said. ''We've gotten under FAIR's skin many times, and now they feel like they have allies in the administration and they're going for it.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Although immigration advocates call them xenophobic, people at all three groups say they do not like to be labeled anti-immigrant; the Center for Immigration Studies uses the motto ''low immigration, pro-immigrant'' on its website. They say they just expect to see the nation's immigration laws enforced and that those living here illegally are caught and deported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  They also say they want legal immigration brought down to what they view as more sustainable levels, in particular to help buoy the wages of lower-income Americans who compete with unskilled migrants on the bottom rungs of the work force.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The average American basically likes the idea of immigration, maybe loves the concept -- it's played an important historic role in our history -- but would be perfectly fine if we didn't have another immigrant for 50 years,'' Mr. Stein said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  FAIR lobbies members of Congress and their staff from its offices on Massachusetts Avenue, a short walk from Capitol Hill, while maintaining strong contacts with talk-radio hosts. There is even a radio studio in the group's office.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  With roughly two dozen staff members and fellows, the Center for Immigration Studies provides research, filling the traditional think-tank role.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  NumbersUSA is perhaps best known for exhorting members to overwhelm senators with faxes -- more than a million were sent -- during an effort in 2007 to pass a bill offering a path to citizenship for millions of illegal immigrants and creating a new temporary worker program. The group likes to point out that it has ''activists in every congressional district,'' as the group's founder, Roy Beck, put it in a recent interview at its office in Arlington, Va. NumbersUSA now claims eight million ''participants'' between its Facebook followers and email lists.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  All three receive small donations from individuals but also millions of dollars in recent years from the Colcom Foundation, a Pittsburgh-based organization founded by Cordelia Scaife May, a Mellon banking heiress, which has given heavily to anti-immigration causes. Her brother, Richard Mellon Scaife, was well known for bankrolling conservative causes and attacks on Bill and Hillary Clinton.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Despite their recent policy victories, the groups remain wary as to whether the administration will follow through on all its promises. In particular they point to Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> failure to immediately end President Barack Obama's policy of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, allowing the so-called Dreamers who came illegally as children to remain in the country, as well as his choice of a pro-immigation economist to lead his Council of Economic Advisers.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''We feel like we are going to continue to need to bring grass-roots influence on this administration because there's a lot of competing interests,'' said Mr. Beck of NumbersUSA.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At the same time, he pointed to a list of 10 priorities that NumbersUSA put out last summer for strengthening enforcement, and noted that the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> administration had already addressed eight of them. One of the other two is ending birthright citizenship for children whose parents are not citizens, a controversial idea that would most likely require a constitutional amendment.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The biggest enemy we face right now is complacency,'' Mr. Stein of FAIR said, ''because </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> people have our ideas.''</SPAN></P>

<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">In the United States, Donald </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> won the White House despite -- and partly because of -- his disdain for Mexicans, Muslims and African-Americans and his flirtation with anti-Semitic tropes. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the face of this ethnic nationalism, citizens often face difficult choices. They have to decide how much of a priority to place on combating it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Should voters eschew their favorite candidate and vote for one with the best chance to defeat the nationalist? Should policy experts be willing to work in an administration that plays footsie with intolerance? Should a museum dedicated to fighting hate, like the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, host a hateful president?</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  These choices often end up being more complicated than they first seem, and I don't want to suggest otherwise. But a disturbing pattern is still emerging.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Too many people -- well-meaning people on both the left and right -- have grown complacent about nationalist bigotry. They are erring on the side of putting other priorities first, and ethnic nationalism is benefiting.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Let's start on the political left. And, no, I'm not about to lapse into false equivalence. Ethnic nationalism is largely a force of the right. But the left needs to decide how to respond, and it hasn't been effective enough so far. It has underestimated the threat and put smaller matters ahead of larger ones.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  After France's first round of voting, the leftist candidate Jean-Luc M&eacute;lenchon refused to endorse the last person who can prevent Le Pen from becoming president, Emmanuel Macron. A Le Pen presidency, to be clear, would likely tear Europe asunder, marginalize French citizens who hail from Africa and the Middle East and lead to a big expansion of security forces. It would be the biggest victory for Europe's far right since World War II, by far.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Yet M&eacute;lenchon still won't back Macron -- a centrist former banker who was until recently a member of the Socialist Party. It's a classic case of political purism that may feel good, but can do grave damage.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Just look at the United States. Updated presidential vote totals show that </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> margins in Michigan, in Pennsylvania and in Wisconsin -- which together would have swung the result -- were smaller than the tally of Jill Stein, the Green Party candidate. It's impossible to know whether Stein's campaign cost Hillary Clinton the election, yet it clearly hurt. In a very close race, parts of the American left aided </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I understand that this point enrages backers of Stein and M&eacute;lenchon. They have real differences of opinion with center-left candidates, and they want to win those debates. But the final round of an election that includes a viable white nationalist isn't a time to hash out the future of progressive politics. It's a time to defeat racism.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A version of this dilemma also applies to the political center. Apolitical institutions have to decide whether they will treat ethno-centrists like </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> and Le Pen differently from other politicians. These institutions are right to resist becoming part of ''the opposition,'' because society needs nonpartisan institutions. But they also have to avoid compromising their mission.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Holocaust Museum has put itself in a tricky spot. It invited </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to give a major speech this morning, much as previous presidents have done. Of course, previous presidents didn't retweet neo-Nazi sympathizers, vilify Muslims or try to airbrush Jews out of the Holocaust.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Maybe the museum's leaders are confident </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> will use the speech as a turning point, which would be wonderful. But by conferring the museum's prestige on </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, those leaders have a new responsibility to call out future dog whistles from the administration. The Holocaust Museum has effectively invested in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Finally, there is the political right. Most Republicans despise the notion that their ideology makes room for bigotry. Theirs is the party of Lincoln and of individual freedom, they say.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Fair enough. But that history brings responsibilities. Today's Republican Party has plainly made room for white nationalism, via Steve King, Steve Bannon, Jeff Sessions and Fox News, not to mention the president.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  If the Holocaust Museum is now invested in </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">, Republicans are really invested in him and his fellow nationalists. You don't get to call yourself the party of Lincoln and stay silent when voting rights are abridged, hate crimes are met with silence and dark-skinned citizens are cast as un-American.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  I never expected to live through a time when bigotry would again be as ascendant. But we are living in that time, and it brings a new set of choices.</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">WASHINGTON -- The </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> administration announced on Monday that it would impose new tariffs on Canadian softwood lumber imports, escalating a longstanding conflict with America's second-largest trading partner.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The Commerce Department determined that Canada had been improperly subsidizing the sale of softwood lumber products to the United States, and after failed negotiations, Washington decided to retaliate with tariffs of 3 percent to 24 percent. The penalties will be collected retroactively on imports dating back 90 days. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The decision came days after President </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> complained bitterly about Canada's dairy trade practices, and the tariffs signaled a harsher turn in his relationship with Canada, even as he seeks to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement. While he has often assailed China, Mexico and others for their trade practices, he seemed to have forged a strong relationship with Canada's prime minister, Justin Trudeau.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The United States and Canada have been at odds over softwood lumber in one form or another since the 19th century, with the current dispute tracing back to 1982. The United States imported $5.7 billion in softwood lumber last year alone, mainly for residential home building.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  At the conflict's heart is a fundamental difference in forestry ownership. In the United States, forest lands are largely held by lumber companies. In Canada, they tend to be owned by the government, and American mills contend that Canadian provinces subsidize their industries by charging low royalty rates for cutting trees. A temporary truce under President George W. Bush, which effectively limited Canadian exports to the United States, expired in 2015.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Responding on Monday to a complaint filed by American mills, the Commerce Department found that five Canadian companies received subsidies worth 3 percent to 24 percent and ordered equivalent tariffs on each of them. For other Canadian lumber companies, it set a tariff rate of 20 percent. The department will issue a final determination in September.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The government of Canada disagrees strongly with the U.S. Department of Commerce's decision to impose an unfair and punitive duty,'' Chrystia Freeland, the minister of foreign affairs, and Jim Carr, the minister of natural resources, said in a joint statement. ''The accusations are baseless and unfounded.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross told The Wall Street Journal that the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> administration had tried to negotiate a settlement but failed. In a separate statement on Monday, he called it ''a bad week for U.S.-Canada trade relations,'' repeating Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> complaints about dairy exports. ''This is not our idea of a properly functioning free trade agreement,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The tariffs are likely to be opposed by American homebuilders, who say they raise the cost of new houses. A study last year by the National Association of Home Builders found that a 15 percent tariff would increase new home prices by 4.2 percent and cost 4,666 full-time jobs.</SPAN></P>

</DIV>
<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">Mike McCabe's neighbors in rural Gillespie, Ill., consider him lucky. After being out of work for a year, he landed a job in January making cardboard boxes at a nearby Georgia-Pacific plant for $19.60 an hour.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">He would agree with them, were it not for the fact that his previous job in a steel mill near St. Louis paid $28 an hour. ''I've had to rethink my whole life to make ends meet on what I'm now making,'' Mr. McCabe said. ''The middle class is struggling for sure, and almost anybody in my position will tell you that.'' </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Middle-class Americans have fared worse in many ways than their counterparts in economically advanced countries in Western Europe in recent decades, according to a study released Monday by the Pew Research Center.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  What is more, as Mr. McCabe's experience suggests, the authors of the Pew study found a broader contraction of the American middle class, even as the ranks of the poor and the rich have grown.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Compared with the Western European experience, the adult population in the U.S. is more economically divided,'' said Rakesh Kochhar, associate director for research at Pew. ''It is more hollowed out in the middle. This speaks to the higher level of income inequality in the United States.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  For example, between 1991 and 2010, the proportion of adults in middle-income households fell to 59 percent from 62 percent, while it rose to 67 percent from 61 percent over the same period in Britain and to 74 percent from 72 percent in France.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Households that earned from two-thirds to double the national median income were defined as middle income in the Pew study; in the United States that translated into annual income of $35,294 to $105,881, after taxes, in 2010.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  A shrinking middle class is not necessarily cause for alarm, if the reason for the contraction is that more people are moving up the income ladder, said David Autor, a professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The proportion at the top did rise, but so did the proportion at the bottom, rising to 26 percent from 25 percent. That is much more worrisome, said Mr. Autor, who was not involved with the Pew study.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Moreover, the middle-income group was smaller -- and the groups at either extreme larger -- in the United States than in any of the 11 Western European countries studied.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And incomes in the middle rose faster in Europe than they did in the United States, according to Pew. Median incomes in the middle tier grew by 9 percent in the United States between 1991 and 2010, compared with a 25 percent gain in Denmark and a 35 percent increase in Britain.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The United States, including the middle class, has a higher median income than nearly all of Europe, even if the Continent is catching up. The median household income in the United States was $52,941 after taxes in 2010, compared with $41,047 in Germany and $41,076 in France.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  And while inequality may be widening, the proportion of households in the upper-income strata rose to 15 percent from 13 percent.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''Financially, the U.S. remains well ahead of the countries in Europe,'' Mr. Kochhar said. ''The difference is how incomes have evolved, and they are catching up.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Although the cutoff of the study, 2010, may have highlighted weak income gains because it was in the immediate aftermath of the Great Recession, he said that was not enough to alter the study's findings.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''It's a clear trend that the middle class in the U.S. is shrinking and not keeping up financially with the upper-income group,'' he said. ''There is an aura of redistribution of income from middle income to upper income.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The study acknowledges that ''middle class'' can connote more than just income -- like a college education, white-collar work, economic security, homeownership or even self-image -- but for the purposes of the study, it was defined by income.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Whether in Europe or the United States, technological change and globalization mean that people who can adapt and learn new skills can reap bigger rewards, Mr. Kochhar said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Since founding LaSalle Network, a staffing company based in Chicago, with two employees nearly 20 years ago, Tom Gimbel has watched revenues grow to a projected $70 million this year.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''I know a lot of people who have done much better in the last five years,'' he said. ''I have people working for me who made $35,000 to $60,000 a few years ago and are earning $60,000 to $150,000 now.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Gimbel, who grew up in a comfortable Chicago suburb, has seen his own fortunes improve as well. ''We didn't want for anything, but my dad wasn't rolling in money,'' he said. ''I've succeeded beyond where my parents were.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On both sides of the Atlantic, the pressure on the middle class is translating into frustration with the political establishment and distrust of the elites.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Like his father and uncle, Mr. McCabe worked at the U.S. Steel mill in Granite City, Ill. But after the plant was idled in late 2015, he looked for a new job rather than waiting to be called back if the economy improved.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  As a result, Mr. McCabe voted for Donald J. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> in the presidential election last year, even though he grew up in what he calls a staunchly Democratic home. ''My dad is probably rolling over in his grave,'' he said.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''But I liked </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> message that he was going to help the middle class and get the jobs back,'' Mr. McCabe said. ''I was amazed that he won, and sat up all night watching.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''You can only wait so long, and your unemployment runs out and you run out of choices,'' he added. ''I'm divorced with no kids. For people with kids, I can only imagine how tough they got it.''</SPAN></P>

<BR><DIV CLASS="c4"><P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">BEIJING -- China's president, Xi Jinping, has urged President </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to show restraint toward North Korea despite signs that the North may be preparing a nuclear test. Mr. Xi made the appeal in a phone call with Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> on Monday that reflected growing alarm over North Korea's plans, which could tip the region into crisis.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">The phone conversation came after Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> had already used a meeting with Mr. Xi in Florida, a follow-up phone call, interviews and Twitter messages to press Mr. Xi to do more to deter North Korea from holding additional nuclear and missile tests. The United States and its allies have been on alert for another atomic test by the North. </SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the latest call, the third between the two leaders, Mr. Xi indicated to Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> that China opposed any such test by North Korea, but he also nudged Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> to avoid a tit-for-tat response to the North's fiery threats, according to a report on Chinese television.</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2">&nbsp;</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''China adamantly opposes any actions in contravention of the United Nations Security Council resolutions,'' Mr. Xi said, according to the report, evidently referring to a series of decisions by the Council to punish North Korea for its nuclear and missile programs.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''At the same time, it is hoped that all sides exercise restraint and avoid doing things that exacerbate tensions on the peninsula,'' Mr. Xi said, referring to the Korean Peninsula. ''Only if all sides live up to their responsibilities and come together from different directions can the nuclear issue on the peninsula be resolved as quickly as possible.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In Washington on Monday, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said ''the status quo in North Korea is also unacceptable,'' and he called on the Security Council to impose new sanctions.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''This is a real threat to the world, whether we want to talk about it or not,'' Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> said at a White House meeting of Security Council envoys. ''North Korea is a big world problem, and it's a problem we have to finally solve. People have put blindfolds on for decades, and now it's time to solve the problem.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Xi's calls for restraint in issuing new sanctions reflected growing Chinese fears that the tensions between North Korea and the United States and its Asian allies could spiral into outright military conflict. That widening rift is presenting China with confounding choices between its longstanding ties to North Korea and its hopes for steady relations with the United States.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The White House said in its brief account of Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> call with Mr. Xi that ''the two leaders reaffirmed the urgency of the threat posed by North Korea's missile and nuclear programs, and committed to strengthen coordination in achieving the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  North Korea did not proceed with a nuclear test on April 15, which some experts had expected, but work apparently resumed at its atomic test site in Punggye-ri, according to analysts who have assessed satellite images of the site.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The flaring tensions over North Korea have reopened cracks in its ties with China, which for decades has provided fuel, trade opportunities and a degree of political cover to North Korea, while other countries have shunned it.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The Chinese government has recently increased pressure on North Korea. In February, China officially suspended coal shipments from North Korea, and a prominent Chinese newspaper has also raised the threat of choking off oil shipments to the North.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  North Korea's official news agency responded over the weekend by warning China of ''catastrophic consequences'' for their relationship if economic sanctions continued, reported Yonhap, the South Korean news service.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But on Monday, a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry stuck to pleas for calm from all sides when asked repeatedly about North Korea, its threats to China and the possibility of another nuclear test.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''The situation on the peninsula is complicated and sensitive,'' the spokesman, Geng Shuang, said when asked about a possible North Korean nuclear test.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On Sunday, Japanese defense forces began a joint drill with a visiting United States Navy strike group featuring an aircraft carrier, the Carl Vinson, which had finally arrived in northeast Asia in a display of American resolve.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In the last two days, the North Korean state news media, including the main Workers' Party newspaper, Rodong Sinmun, has warned that the North is ready to turn the Carl Vinson into a ''great heap of scrap metal'' and ''bury it in the sea.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  The South Korean Defense Ministry said on Monday that it was also considering holding joint drills with the Carl Vinson and accompanying ships, Reuters reported.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  In addition to his discussion with Mr. Xi, Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> also spoke with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan on Monday morning in Tokyo, Mr. Abe told reporters.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Abe told the president that he strongly endorsed Mr. </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Trump's</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> position that all options were ''on the table.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  ''North Korea's nuclear and missile program is an extremely serious threat to security not only in the international community, but also for our country,'' Mr. Abe said. ''We will continue to closely cooperate and maintain the high level of warning and surveillance. We will respond resolutely.''</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But Washington and allied governments believe that North Korea's weapons development is getting closer to mastering the means to hit the continental United States with a ballistic missile. And they have become increasingly impatient with China to do more to rein in North Korea.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  On the other hand, Beijing argues that Washington must also do more to end the volatile impasse with Pyongyang. Chinese diplomats have urged the United States to suspend major military exercises with South Korea in return for North Korea's suspending nuclear and missile tests.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Mr. Xi's government has also fiercely opposed an antimissile system -- called the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system, or Thaad -- that the </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> administration has begun installing in South Korea. China argues that the system could also be rejiggered to spy on its missiles.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  But White House officials have said North Korea must prove it is serious about dismantling its nuclear and missiles programs before new negotiations are possible.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Top </SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c9">Trump</SPAN><SPAN CLASS="c2"> administration officials plan to brief the entire Senate Wednesday on the evolving situation with North Korea. The briefing will include Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, Dan Coats, the director of national intelligence, and Joseph F. Dunford Jr., the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  Adding to the friction, North Korea detained a United States citizen over the weekend, adding to the two Americans already known to be in custody there. The latest man believed to be held, Tony Kim, had been teaching accounting at the Pyongyang University of Science and Technology.</SPAN></P>
<P CLASS="c8"><SPAN CLASS="c2">  This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.         </SPAN></P>
